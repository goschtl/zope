Zelenium Product README
=======================

Overview
--------

This product allows developers to create TTW Selenium test suites
inside their Zope instance, in order to do browser-based functional
testing of their site.

Because it contains third-party code (the Selenium Javascript libraries,
in particular), licensed under non-ZPL licenses, the trunk of the project
has moved its development to Launchpad.  To check it out::
