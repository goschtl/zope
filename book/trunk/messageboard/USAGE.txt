USAGE

Each step package assumes that it is the ``book.messageboard`` package. 

Therefore the best thing to do is to download this entire package under
``messageboard`` and then simply create a symbolic link::

  ln -s messageboard/stepX Zope3/src/book/messagboard

Note: You have to create a ``book`` directory with an empty ``__init__.py``
file, so that this path is recognized as a Python package.

The highest step number should represent the most complete version. You then
simply hook up the application by adding a file called
``messageboard-configure.zcml`` to ``Zope3/package-includes``. The file should
contain a single line of the form::

  <include package="book.messageboard" />

For detailed installation and setup instructions see the Content Components
recipe at http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/DevelCookbook/NewContentObject.
