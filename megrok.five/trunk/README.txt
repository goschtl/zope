megrok.five
===========

``megrok.five`` provides integration of the grok library into Zope 2.
Currently, it supports:

* adapters, utilities, annotations (they're generic to both Zope 2 and 3)

* views (``grok.View``) with Page Templates

* forms (``grok.EditForm``, ``grok.AddForm``)

It also supplies two new base classes, ``Model`` and ``Application``,
which are Zope 2-enabled versions of their grok equivalents.
