The Zope Toolkit
================

The Zope Toolkit is a collection of libraries managed by the Zope
developers. The Zope Toolkit is not installable directly, but
libraries in it are.

Zope Toolkit libraries are intended to be reusable by projects to
develop web applications or web frameworks. Currently some of the Zope
Toolkit libraries are more reusable in this way than others, but we
are working on getting them all in shape.

The whole collection of Zope Toolkit libraries in used in various
other web frameworks and web application servers. Three of these are
managed by the Zope project: Zope 2, Zope 3 and Grok. If you install
one of these systems, you will get the Zope Toolkit along with it
automatically.

The :ref:`steering-group` is there to help guide the development
of the Zope Toolkit.
