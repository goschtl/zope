Bug tracking
============

Zope 3 bugs are tracked using Launchpad's bugtracker at
https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3.

Bugs from the previous bugtracker (which lived somewhere below
http://www.zope.org/Collectors) have aliases of the form zope3dev-NNN where NNN
is the old bug number, so they can be retrieved by searching for these on
Launchpad.

``XXX``, ``FIXME`` or ``TODO`` comments in the source code are not
considered bugs and therefore cannot block releases. Consider adding a
bug in addition to the comment. If something is really broken and you
want to indicate it with ``XXX``, consider instead not checking this
into the trunk of a project at all.
