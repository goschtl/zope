Zope Toolkit
============

The Zope Toolkit (ZTK) is a set of libraries intended for reuse by projects to
develop web applications or web frameworks. It is developed by the
contributors of the Zope Foundation.

The whole collection of ZTK libraries are used in various web
frameworks and web application servers. Three of these are managed by
the Zope project: BlueBream, Grok and Zope 2. If you install one of these
systems, you will get a part of the ZTK along with it automatically.

The :ref:`release-team` is there to coordinate the release of new versions
of the ZTK and make sure the interests of the three Zope projects are
respected.

.. note::
    The ZTK is not installable by itself directly, but its libraries are.
