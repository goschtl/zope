Steering Group
==============

The formation of the Zope Toolkit was facilitated by the Zope Toolkit
Steering Group. It was influential in defining the scope of the ZTK and
establishing community practices and policies around it.

In early 2010 the steering group members stepped down, after succeeding in
the creation of the toolkit concept and getting wide community support for it.

After the steering group members stepped down, the Zope community agreed on
the formation of the release team (:ref:`release-team`) with a much narrower
focus around release management of the ZTK.
