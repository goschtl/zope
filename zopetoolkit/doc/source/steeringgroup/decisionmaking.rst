How we can help you
===================

If you want to make some change to the Zope Toolkit, start a thread
on zope-dev about it. The Steering Group is watching.

The Steering Group is going to make decisions in the following way:

* A steering group member participates in discussions as normally,
  saying +1 or -1 or whatever alternative suggestions they may have.

* If it's clear there's a consensus by the steering group, we will
  record the decision in a document in SVN to be announced. If not all
  steering group members voted and it's "enough time" later, fine, the
  decision is made by those who did care to contribute.

* If there is no consensus by the steering group, the most votes by
  steering group members in the thread win. It is the task of the
  steering group to detect this and record it (or delegate its
  recording by someone else, even better).

* If for some reason it's hard to count votes and get consensus in the
  Steering Group, people can point this out. "Steering Group help, no
  consensus detected!". We will then reach a consensus.

* If there's still no consensus, Martijn is going to flip a coin and
  that's going to be the answer. Martijn going to do his best to avoid
  having to flip any coins, as it's very silly to decide on the flip
  of a coin.

* If you are doing a larger project of changing the code (as opposed
  to minor changes or bugfixes), you should make a proposal on the
  mailing list and get a steering group member to participate in the
  discussion.

* If it's a small topic and no steering group member participates in a
  discussion and consensus is reached, please proceed. Everything's
  fine.

* So, you only need to worry about the steering group for relatively
  large issues, and when they're actually participating in a
  discussion. You can also invoke the steering group if you don't like
  the consensus reached in a discussion or if no consensus is reached.

* Feel free to call in the Steering Group and it will fly in.  It's
  not a bird, it's not a plane, it's the Steering Group!
