Bug tracking
============

ZTK bugs are tracked in individual projects (one per package) using Launchpad's
bug tracker at https://bugs.launchpad.net/zopetoolkit.

``XXX``, ``FIXME`` or ``TODO`` comments in the source code are not
considered bugs and therefore cannot block releases. Consider adding a
bug in addition to the comment. If something is really broken and you
want to indicate it with ``XXX``, consider instead not checking this
into the trunk of a project but into a separate working branch.


Bug days
--------

On a loose monthly schedule bug days are organized. The developer community
gets together on these days to triage and resolve bugs in Zope projects.

Bug days are announced on the zope-dev mailing list (:ref:`mailing-list`).


Historical bugs
---------------

Historically, bugs have been tracked with the Zope 3 project
(https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3).

Even longer ago, Zope 3 used its own bug tracker (which lived at
http://www.zope.org/Collectors). Those were imported into the Launchpad bug
database and have aliases of the form "zope3dev-NNN" where "NNN" is the old
bug number, so they can be retrieved by searching for these on Launchpad.
