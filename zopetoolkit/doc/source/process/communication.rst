Communication

Communication for the Zope Toolkit development itself happens both
on IRC and in a mailing list.

Mailing list
------------

The official Zope Toolkit development mailing list is
zope-dev@zope.org. You can subscribe to it by visiting
http://mail.zope.org/mailman/listinfo/zope-dev.

.. note::
    In the earlier days of Zope 3 development we used to have a
    separate mailing list for development on Zope 3
    (zope3-dev@zope.org). This list was merged into the general
    zope-dev@zope.org list a while ago.
