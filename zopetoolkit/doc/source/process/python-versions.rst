============================

The Zope Toolkit supports different versions of Python for its releases.

ZTK 1.0
-------

The ZTK 1.0.x release series supports the following versions of Python:

* Python 2.4

* Python 2.5

* Python 2.6

This means that no features beyond Python 2.4 should be used in any
library that is part of this Zope Toolkit series.


ZTK 1.1
-------

The ZTK 1.1.x release series supports the following versions of Python:

* Python 2.5

allowed to make use of Python 2.5+ features and break compatibility with
Python 2.4.

Newer Python versions might be supported by the release.
