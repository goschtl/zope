Discussion
----------

* j-w moved the `zope.app.*` packages to the deprecated-section.

* There was a short discussion on zope-dev about using distribute
  versus setuptools. The releaseteam conclusion was not to introduce
  any (implicit) dependencies on either. Hanno suggested to test the
  ZTK packages for (unintentional) dependencies on distribute.

* There're a few ZTK packages trunks that refer to yet-unreleased
  versions of their dependencies. This means, these trunk a hard to
  release, but more importantly, these packages will not be easily
  testable in buildbots.

  Various options were discussed including: using mr.developer and its
  auto-checkout features, refrain from testing trunks in buildbot or
  have developments done on a packages that requires a new release of
  a dependency, done on development branches. This latter seems to be
  the sensible approach.

  J-w will make a list of packages trunks that have this issue.

Tasks
-----

* Check for ZTK packages that would rely on distribute [hannosch]

* Check for package trunks that rely on yet unreleased version of its
  dependencies [j-w]

* Update the version in the ZTK [ccomb]

Next meeting

Next meeting is scheduled for December 7th 20:30 (CET) on #zope.
