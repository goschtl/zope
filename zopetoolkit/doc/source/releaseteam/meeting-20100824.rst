Minutes of last meeting

- The minutes of the last meeting were principally agreed on.

Tasks

- hannosch updated the *.cfg's deprecating zope.app.* packages that are not used
  by the consuming frameworks.

- j-w got access to download.zope.org for making ZTK releases. He will do the
  next alpha release just after this meeting.

- There're still Windows-related test failures for the ZTK. Work still needs to
  be done to identify and fix these issues.

- ccomb brought up the issue of sharing a list of packages between BB and
  Grok that will not be part of the ZTK. The suggestion is to start
  collaborating on such a list between the respective communities.

Tasks
-----

- Make the 1.0a3 release. [j-w]

- Windows test failures [j-w]

- Add a remark about the discover-ztk buildbot to the release-procedures.rst
  file [ccomb].

Next meeting

Next meeting is scheduled for September 7th 16:00 (CEST) on #zope.
