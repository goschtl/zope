Discussion
----------

* Hannosch tested the ZTK packages for unintentional dependencies on distribute
  versus setuptools. His conclusion was there is no such dependency at this
  point. This is good.

* Several package trunks relied on un-released versions of other packages.
  Hannosch released several packages to resolve this situation.

* z3c.recipe.compattest needs a release to fix its inability to run in a
  virtualenv. This will be taken care of by Jan-Jaap Driessen.
