Minutes of last meeting

- The minutes were principally agreed on.

ZTK-layout

- Hannosch updated http://docs.zope.org/zopetoolkit/about/libraries.html to
  reflect the ztk release team's vision.

- zope.file and zope.html will be removed from the ztk as they do not seem
  fundamental to the toolkit.

- Work will continue for the other "under-review" packages.

- Work will continue on implementing the decided packages policy in the ZTK.

- Zope2's next release will be an alpha next week. The final is target
  somewhere in september/october. Conceptually this new Zope2
  release will be based on ZTK 1.0.

  1.1.0 alpha to a final.
