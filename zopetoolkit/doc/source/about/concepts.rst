We summarize some terms and concepts so we can all agree on how we
refer to things in discussions.

Zope 3 (preferred: Zope 3 application server)
  Zope 3 as an application server, includes a way to create projects.
  Currently also contains the ZMI. Since 2010, Zope 3 as an application server
  has been renamed to BlueBream.

    of a project template and it uses the Zope Toolkit. It also provides a

    and Grok community.

    expand on Zope technology.

    such as Plone or CPS.

Plone

Zope Toolkit
    the collection of Zope Toolkit core libraries. Neither includes the ZMI
    nor includes a particular way to create a project.

    together. This set receives a collective version number ("Zope Toolkit
    1.0"). A release could simply consist of a list of version numbers.
