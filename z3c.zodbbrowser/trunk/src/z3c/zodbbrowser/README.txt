The ZODB Browser is a wxPython client application which can visualize the 
ZODB internals. After starting the ZODB Browser, you can open a Data.fs and
traverse the database objects in a tree view.

The tool operates in READ ONLY mode. It is meant as a debugging aid for
sysadmins.

A big thank you goes to Adam Groszer, which started this great work at the 
Swiss Easter Sprint. Feel free to ask on the zope3-dev at zope.org mailinglist
if you have question.
