- Clean up the MDI UI -- wax is not tops with that
  Maybe switch to wx.aui when 2.7 will be stable

- Fails with z3c.baseregistry, investigate why, how to solve

- Implement different openers
  - for ZEO
  - directoryStorage
  - what else?

- Implement the `transaction` view
  That shows the transactions list, something like fstest.py

- Implement `open new tree from here`
  That opens a new window setting the current object as root
