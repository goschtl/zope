Notes
-----

Right now the wxPython version 2.6 is used. Teh newer version doesn't work on
my windows box, because there is a mess in the wxPython library. I guess they
changed import wxPython to import wx and right now not all subpackages are 
ported to this naming. Adam, should we switch to wxPythn version 2.7 or does 
the Wax package not support this version right now?
