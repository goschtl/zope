Products.CMFDefault Changelog

  Products.CMFDefault 2.2.0 (unreleased)

    - views: Added ContentEditFormBase and FileAddView.
      This shows how form-driven content creation works. The content is created
      without using the constructor methods provided by the types tool.

    - DublinCore: Modified the 'addCreator' implementation.
      It no longer depends on the membership tool.

    - DiscussionItem: Removed 'addDiscussionItem' function.
      This was dead code. 'createReply' is used for adding DiscussionItems.

    - content: Factories no longer sends add events.

    - profiles: Removed obsolete local import and export step registrations.

    - setup handler: Improved 'various' import step.
      Added flag file check and global registration.

    - Document and NewsItem: It is now possible to register a utility
      (ILinebreakNormalizer) that can normalize line breaks upon editing or
      rendering out to FTP.
