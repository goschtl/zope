Creating a self-contained source release of the Zookeeper Python Binding
========================================================================

These instructions will likely need to be updated as the Zookeeper
Python binding evolves.

Run the script ``get_source_files.py`` passing the name of a directory
containing an unpacked source distribution.  For example::

   python get_source_files.py ~/s/zookeeper-3.3.3

Hack the script if necessary. :)

Run setup with setuptools (or distutils) in the path::

   python setup.py sdist

Publish the resulting source distribution.
