z3c.vcsync changes
==================

0.8.2 (unreleased)
-----------------

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

* In some cases a containing directory is referenced which does not
  exist anymore when removing files. In this case we do not need to
  remove the file anymore, as the directory itself is gone.

* SVN doesn't actually remove directories, just mark them for
  removal. This could confuse the system during synchronization:
  removed directories might reappear again as they were still on the
  filesystem during loading. Make sure now that any directories marked
  for removal are also properly removed in the filesystem before load
  starts, but after up (as rm-ing a directory marked for removal
  before svn up will actually re-add this directory!).

0.8.1 (2007-11-07)
------------------

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

* Fix a bug in conversion of SVN timestamps to datetimes. Previous
  code worked in DST, but not during winter time. The new code might
  of course break under DST - the mysterious of datetime conversion
  are legion.

* A cleaner way to cache the files listing from SVN.

* Work around a bug in the Py library. The Py library doesn't support
  the R status code from SVN and raises a NotImplementedError when it
  encounters it. Evilly catch these NotImplementedErrors for now. The
  bug has been reported upstream and should be fixed in the next
  release of Py.
