z3c.vcsync changes
==================

0.8.1 (2007-11-07)
------------------

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

* Fix a bug in conversion of SVN timestamps to datetimes. Previous
  code worked in DST, but not during winter time. The new code might
  of course break under DST - the mysterious of datetime conversion
  are legion.

* A cleaner way to cache the files listing from SVN.

* Work around a bug in the Py library. The Py library doesn't support
  the R status code from SVN and raises a NotImplementedError when it
  encounters it. Evilly catch these NotImplementedErrors for now. The
  bug has been reported upstream and should be fixed in the next
  release of Py.
