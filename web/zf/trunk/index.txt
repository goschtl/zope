Welcome

The Zope Foundation has the goal to promote, maintain, and develop the
Zope platform. It does this by supporting the Zope community. Our
community includes the open source community of contributors to the
Zope software, contributors to the documentation and web
infrastructure, as well as the community of businesses and
organizations that use Zope.

The Zope Foundation is the copyright holder of the Zope software and
many extensions and associated software. The Zope Foundation also
manages the zope.org website, and manages the infrastructure for open
source collaboration.
