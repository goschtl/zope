About the Zope Foundation
=========================

The Zope Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation that provides
support for the Zope community and the Zope platform and its
associated software. Our community includes the open source community
of contributers as well as the community of businesses and
organizations that use Zope.

The aim of the Zope Foundation is to assist these communities in
moving the Zope platform forward. It does this in several ways:

* **The future of Zope is ensured.** The foundation is an independent
  body that holds the copyrights to the Zope source code. It also
  maintains the zope.org website. The foundation is therefore able to
  ensure the continued promotion and development of the platform.

* **Accountable open source.** The Foundation, through its `copyright
  assignment policy`_, makes sure that any contributions by community
  members are placed under a liberal open source license (the `ZPL
  2.2`_), and are copyrighted by the Zope Foundation. This makes the
  Zope platform safe to use in any open source or proprietary
  settings.

* **Support the community.** The Zope community is made up of
  volunteers that care about the Zope platform. We help in organizing
  these volunteers so they have the ability to get things done and
  move Zope forward.

* **Promotion of Zope.** The Zope Foundation promotes Zope. One
  important channel we use to promote Zope is the zope.org website,
  which is managed by the foundation.

* **Project infrastructure.** Contributors to the Zope platform make
  use of extensive infrastructure in order to collaborate, ranging
  from mailing lists and issue trackers to version control
  systems. The Zope Foundation, thanks to the contributions of its
  members, maintains this infrastructure.
