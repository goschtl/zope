Zope Foundation Committer Members
=================================

Individuals who give frequent and valuable contributions to the Zope
platform can have their status promoted to that of "Committer
Member". A Committer Member has write access to the Foundation's
source code repository.  Becoming a Committer Member is a privilege
that is earned by contributing and showing discipline and good
judgement.

The Committer membership is represented on the Zope Foundation board
by Committer Directors. There are as many Committer Directors on the
board as there are Strategic Developer directors (and always at least
1). The Committer Members elect their Committer Directors using the
Single Transferrable Vote process from among their membership.
