Zope projects
=============

The Zope Foundation provides support for the communities surrounding a
number of projects, large and small. We give an overview of some of
the larger projects maintained by the Zope community.

Zope 2
------

The Zope 2 web application platform has been under continuous
development as an open source system since 1998. A large amount of
software has been built on top of it. Well-known Zope-based projects
are the Plone_ and Silva_ content management systems, and the ERP5_
enterprise resource planning software.

Zope 3
------

Zope 3 is the next generation web platform developed by the Zope
community. It has been under development since 2001, and became ready
for production in 2005. Zope 3 is a developer-oriented platform. It
aims to provide a collection of fine-grained components that can be
combined to build powerful web applications.

Zope 3 can be used as an independent server platform, but can also be
used in combination with Zope 2, using the Five integration layer.

zope.org website
----------------

The zope.org website is the public face of the Zope project. It aims
to explain Zope to newcomers as well as guide developers to the
various subprojects.
