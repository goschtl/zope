- Write the z3monitor tests.
- Write a stress test.
- Finish the README_2 docs.
- Write a way to use alone, with a separate zdaemon script.
- Write a way to use with Zope 3 (in particular, something that waits for the
 database opened event that Zope 3 fires).
- remove subscribers.py, or make it part of the Zope 3 bit above.
- write basic zcml (necessary adapters) and full (more policy) zcml

For future versions:

- TTW Management and logging views, as in zasync (see goals in the "History"
  section of the README).
- Write a Zope 3 request/context munger that sets security context and site
  based on current values.
- queues should be pluggable like agent with filter
- show how to broadcast, maybe add conveniences
