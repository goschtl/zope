- make trace log only write changes or occasionally
- make data structure for old polls more efficient
- make period for polls and jobs shorter
- make failures reduce to small size (eliminate stack?)
- make full tracebacks write to log, or at least an option
- Write the z3monitor tests.
- Write a stress test.

For future versions:

- TTW Management and logging views, as in zasync (see goals in the "History"
  section of the README).
- Write a Zope 3 request/context munger that sets security context and site
  based on current values.
- queues should be pluggable like agent with filter
- show how to broadcast, maybe add conveniences
