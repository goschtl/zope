- Make a test showing the queues in another database.
- Write the z3monitor code.
- Write a stress test.
- Make the README an introductory text, and move the current one to the side.
- Write a way to use with Zope 3 (in particular, something that waits for the
 database opened event that Zope 3 fires).  *Separate* from main code, with a
  separate test runner and a separate list of eggs.
- remove subscribers.py, or make it part of the Zope 3 bit above.
- write basic zcml (necessary adapters) and full (more policy) zcml

For future versions:

- TTW Management and logging views, as in zasync (see goals in the "History"
  section of the README).
- Write a Zope 3 request/context munger that sets security context and site
  based on current values.
- Maybe become friendly to Medusa.
