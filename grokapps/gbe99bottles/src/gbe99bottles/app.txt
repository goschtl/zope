Do a functional doctest test on the app.
========================================

:Test-Layer: functional

Let's first create an instance of the Song at the top level:

   >>> from gbe99bottles.app import Song
   >>> root = getRootFolder()
   >>> root['song'] = Song()

Creating the Song initializes the Wall and puts 99 beers on it.

   >>> root['song']['wall'].contents()
   99

Create a Browser and visit the instance you just created:

   >>> from zope.testbrowser.testing import Browser
   >>> browser = Browser()
   >>> browser.open('http://localhost/song')

Sing the '99 Bottles of Beer' Song (original lyrics at
http://99-bottles-of-beer.net/lyrics.html):

   >>> print browser.contents
   99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
   Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.
   ...
   2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.
   Take one down and pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall.
   <BLANKLINE>
   1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
   Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.
   <BLANKLINE>
   No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.
   Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.

Again check the number of beers on the wall.

   >>> root['song']['wall'].contents()
   99
