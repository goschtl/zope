This is a list of bugs to fix and improvements to make in Kirbi. Improvements
listed here are mostly technical: refactorings, optimizations etc. There is
a list of planned features in README.txt and new ideas should be put there.

* move cover images into ZODB (perhaps using blob support)

* make kirbi startup start kirbifetch as well
