zopyx.smartprintng.core
=======================

This package contains the refactored code-base of the SmartPrintNG
product for Plone. The former monolithic implementation is broken into 
a three-level architecture (top-down):

 - zopyx.smartprintng.plone - the integration layer with Plone
 - zopyx.smartprintng.core - the SmartPrintNG backend
 - zopyx.convert2 - the low-level converter API
