Masquerading
============

If the environment variable ``PAS_MASQUERADING`` is set to ``on``, masquerading
is enabled.

Then, logging in as AUTHUSER/ROLEUSER (e.g. 'admin/jdoe') authenticates against 
AUTHUSER but returns ROLEUSER. As a security precaution, AUTHUSER must have
the Manager or the Masquerader role. 

Note: AUTHUSER and ROLEUSER must live in the same user folder.
