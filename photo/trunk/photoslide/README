PhotoSlide Product

  Overview

    This product is a container which can contain photos. It will keep
    you from configure every single photo since the photos can use the 
    this product's options. It also provides some views of the all the
    photos. Currently the views aren't that nice and could really need
    a better look.

    It also contains a PhotoSlide Folder. The only advantage of using
    this right now is if you create a folder inside it via FTP, it will
    create a PhotoSlide. Later on it should also provide a view of the
    slide shows which it contain.

  Dependencies

    It requires that zopeproducts.photo is installed.
    
  Current Status

    At the moment this product is usable, the most important thing to
    fix is to make the views look nicer.
