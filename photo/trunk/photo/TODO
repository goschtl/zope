* Provide a nice icon

    Currently there's no icon associated with this product.
    
* Support for external storage

    Storing a lot of images inside ZODB makes it unnecessary big and
    slow. It would be better to only store meta data there and store
    the actual images somewhere else, like the file system or an
    external database.

* Fix generation of new image sizes

    At the moment new image sizes only get created when someone requests
    it and the new image never gets deleted. There should be an option
    to pre-generate certain sizes. There should also be some kind of
    cache timeout, so that the images get deleted after a while.

* Customization of display sizes

    Now there are hard coded list of display sizes. It should be possible
    to edit this list.

* EXIF support

    Extract EXIF data from the image.

* Run images through filters while resizing

    It would be nice to say, for example, that the thumbnails should
    have rounded corners. My main idea here is that for each display
    size you can specify a number of filter through which the resized
    image will be processed.

* Put PILImageUtility and ImageMagickUtility into seperate packages

    Those are not specific to this product and could be useful for others
    to use. Of course they would need some more functionality as well.

* More functional tests

    I noticed that quite often when I developed this product, all the unit
    tests passed, but in reality the product was broken. Would be nice to
    have some tests which can tell that it is broken.
