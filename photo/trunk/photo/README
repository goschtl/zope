Photo Product

  Overview

    This product enables you to have multiple sizes of an image. You
    only have to supply it with an image and it will automatically
    generate the size you ask it for. It also can store some meta
    data about the image.

    It is much influenced by the Photo product in Zope 2, but it
    is not a direct port of it.

  Display Sizes

    Right now it contains a static set of different sizes of the image.
    This will change though, so that you can specify the sizes you
    want.

  Image Utilities

    In order to resize the image it uses an image utility. It will give
    you a list of available image utilities. You can choose any utility
    which implements IImageResizeUtility. Two utilites are provided in
    this package. One which uses ImageMagick and another which uses PIL.

    Note that in order to use the ImageMagick utility the 'convert'
    program has to be in your PATH. To use the PIL utility the PIL
    module has to be installed. 

  Uploading Photos

    There are two ways of uploading photos. One is to do it through
    the browser by adding a photo in the ZMI. Though if you want to
    upload many photos you're better off creating a photo aware folder,
    like the PhotoSlide product. You can also create a normal folder
    and mark it with the IPhotoFolder interface. Then every image
    you upload to that folder will becom a photo.

  Current Status

    At the moment this product is quite usable, though there's still
    a lot to be done. See the TODO for more information
