Changes
=======

2.0.1 (unknown)
------------------

- Allow users to specify the domain and port of the wsgi_intercept_layer by
  adding those attributes to the class.
- Fix testbrowser support a bit so that it performs more like
  zope.testbrowser.testing.Browser.

2.0.0 (2009-04-01)
------------------

- Remove dependencies by using zope.configuration.xmlconfig to setup zcml
  rather than zope.app.appsetup.  This leaves out some security configuration
  but the win from less dependencies is massive. In my tests, no tests had any
  issues with this.
- Add a wsgi_intercept layer and a functional_layer that combines both zcml
  and wsgi_intercept layer.

1.0.0 (2008-11-21)
------------------

- Initial Release
