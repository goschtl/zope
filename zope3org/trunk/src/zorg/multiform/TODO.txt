TODO
====

We are at the very beginning. The first concrete multiform is
container.views.ContainerGridForm. The actions should work fine.

Missing functionalities:
------------------------

	- customwidget for container.interfaces.IMovableLocation['__name__']

		Returns an inputwidget if an IInputWidget is needed and returns
		an displaywidget if an IDisplayWidget is needed.
	
	- Size columns

	    Enable to register a size information field (ISized has only IMethods).
	    Pay attention to register a customwidget to display the size.

	- Sort and Batch

		Write sort and batch handling in the template. Show the current sort
		column and sort direction. Show the current batch.
	
	- Catch DuplicateError in handle_save_action
	
	- View Errors and Status of each ItemForm
	
	- Use namedtemplate for ContainerGridForm
	
	- write more test in gridform.txt
	
		Test singleedit and singlesave

	- write functional tests for ContainerGridForm

	- sort_down and sort_up gifs from the skin
	
		It would be a nice feature of a skin to provides these to icons
