Migrating from version 1.0.1

Create a new index on the object_state table.  The new iterative pack code
will operate slowly without this index.  The following statement works in
all 3 supported databases:

    CREATE INDEX object_state_prev_tid ON object_state (prev_tid);

Also, for PostgreSQL only, apply this pack optimization:

    DROP INDEX pack_object_keep_zoid;
    CREATE INDEX pack_object_keep_false ON pack_object (zoid)
        WHERE keep = false;
    CREATE INDEX pack_object_keep_true ON pack_object (zoid, keep_tid)
        WHERE keep = true;
