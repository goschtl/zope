Searchable text extraction for plain text documents
===================================================

The `zc.index.text` module provides an adapter to extract searchable text from
a plain text file.  The document must be stored in a content object that is
adaptable to `zope.file.interfaces.IFile`, must have an adapter to
`zope.mimetype.interfaces.IContentInfo` that has a "charset" value in its
`effectiveParameters` and is willing to decode.  Having an IContentInfo that
is willing to decode a file will typically mean having a utility that provides
`zope.mimetype.interfaces.ICharsetCodec`, registered with the name of the
charset, but that is hidden in the `IContentInfo.decode` implementation.  We
will mock that part up.

Now let's create an `IFile` object to work with::

  >>> import zc.index.tests

  >>> doc = zc.index.tests.SampleFile("mary.txt")

Let's create the adapter now::

  >>> import zc.index.text

  >>> adapter = zc.index.text.TextSearchableText(doc)

Now we need to register the IContentInfo adapter.

  >>> import zope.component
  >>> zope.component.provideAdapter(zc.index.tests.MockContentInfo)

The `ISearchableText` interface defines a single method,
`getSearchableText()`, which returns a sequence of Unicode strings.
Since our example document does contain meaningful text (the lyrics
for "Mary had a little lamb"), we can check that the sequence isn't
empty::

  >>> text = list(adapter.getSearchableText())
  >>> bool(text)
  True

Let's build a simple set of words based on the result, and check for
known words from the text to make sure they showed up in the results::

  >>> words = zc.index.tests.wordsFromText(text)

  >>> "Mary" in words
  True
  >>> "little" in words
  True
  >>> "school" in words
  True

These have been 'decoded' in our MockContentInfo adapter, so they should all be
unicode:

  >>> [w for w in words if not isinstance(w, unicode)]
  []

We'll also check some words that shouldn't appear in the lyrics for
this childhood favorite::

  >>> "Python" in words
  False
  >>> "Zope" in words
  False
