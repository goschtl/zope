Searchable text extraction for HTML documents
=============================================

The `zc.index.html` module provides an adapter to extract searchable text from
an html file.  The document must be stored in a content object that is
adaptable to `zope.file.interfaces.IFile`, must have an adapter to
`zope.mimetype.interfaces.IContentInfo` that has a "charset" value in its
`effectiveParameters` and is willing to decode.  Having an IContentInfo that
is willing to decode a file will typically mean having a utility that provides
`zope.mimetype.interfaces.ICharsetCodec`, registered with the name of the
charset, but that is hidden in the `IContentInfo.decode` implementation.  We
will mock that part up.

Now let's create an `IFile` object to work with::

  >>> import zc.index.tests

  >>> doc = zc.index.tests.SampleFile("mary.html")

Let's create the adapter now::

  >>> import zc.index.html

  >>> adapter = zc.index.html.HTMLSearchableText(doc)

Now we need to register the IContentInfo adapter.

  >>> import zope.component
  >>> zope.component.provideAdapter(zc.index.tests.MockContentInfo)

The `ISearchableText` interface defines a single method,
`getSearchableText()`, which returns a sequence of Unicode strings.
Since our example document does contain meaningful text (the lyrics
for "Mary had a little lamb"), we can check that the sequence isn't
empty::

  >>> text = list(adapter.getSearchableText())
  >>> bool(text)
  True

Let's build a simple set of words based on the result, and check for
known words from the text to make sure they showed up in the results::

  >>> words = zc.index.tests.wordsFromText(text)

  >>> "Mary" in words
  True
  >>> "little" in words
  True
  >>> "school" in words
  True
  >>> "eager" in words # separated by <br/> tags
  True
  >>> "lingered" in words # divided by tags like <strong>
  True

These have been 'decoded' in our MockContentInfo adapter, so they should all be
unicode:

  >>> [w for w in words if not isinstance(w, unicode)]
  []

We'll also check some words that shouldn't appear in the lyrics for
this childhood favorite::

  >>> "Python" in words
  False
  >>> "Zope" in words
  False

We'll also check to make sure that words in the file that should not have been
indexed--because they were in comments, script tags, style tags, or
attributes--were not included.

  >>> "supposed" in words # in a multi-line comment
  False
  >>> "ha" in words # in a single-line comment
  False
  >>> "red" in words # in a style tag
  False
  >>> "var" in words # in a script tag
  False
  >>> "div" in words # a tag name
  False

On the other hand, a few special words should be included.  Words in the title
should be included.

  >>> 'Presentation' in words
  True

Also words in the value of submit buttons and text fields should be included.

  >>> 'loves' in words # in a test field
  True
  >>> 'reply' in words # in a submit value
  True

Entities are translated.

  >>> 'M&aacute;ry' in words
  False
  >>> u'Máry' in words
  True
  >>> '&#924;ary' in words
  False
  >>> u'Μary' in words # that's a greek capital Mu at the beginning there
  True
