Searchable text extraction for OpenOffice Writer documents
==========================================================

The `zc.index.ooffice` module provides an adapter to extract
searchable text from a OpenOffice Writer document or template.  The
document must be stored in a content object that is adaptable to
`zope.file.interfaces.IFile`.

Now let's create an `IFile` object to work with::

  >>> import zc.index.tests

  >>> doc = zc.index.tests.SampleFile("mary.sxw")

Let's create the adapter now::

  >>> import zc.index.ooffice

  >>> adapter = zc.index.ooffice.WriterSearchableText(doc)

The `ISearchableText` interface defines a single method,
`getSearchableText()`, which returns a sequence of Unicode strings.
Since our example document does contain meaningful text (the lyrics
for "Mary had a little lamb"), we can check that the sequence isn't
empty::

  >>> text = list(adapter.getSearchableText())
  >>> bool(text)
  True

Let's build a simple set of words based on the result, and check for
known words from the text to make sure they showed up in the results::

  >>> words = zc.index.tests.wordsFromText(text)

  >>> "Mary" in words
  True
  >>> "little" in words
  True
  >>> "school" in words
  True

We'll also check some words that shouldn't appear in the lyrics for
this childhood favorite::

  >>> "Python" in words
  False
  >>> "Zope" in words
  False

This adapter also works with OpenOffice Writer template documents, so
let's check that::

  >>> doc = zc.index.tests.SampleFile("mary.stw")
  >>> adapter = zc.index.ooffice.WriterSearchableText(doc)

We'll get the text from the document::

  >>> text = list(adapter.getSearchableText())
  >>> bool(text)
  True

And we'll make the same content checks we did for the regular
document, since our sample template has the same content::

  >>> words = zc.index.tests.wordsFromText(text)

  >>> "Mary" in words
  True
  >>> "little" in words
  True
  >>> "school" in words
  True

  >>> "Python" in words
  False
  >>> "Zope" in words
  False
