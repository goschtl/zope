zope.security Package Changelog
===============================

zope.security version 3.2.0 (2006/01/05)
----------------------------------------

- Corresponds to the verison of the zope.security package shipped as part of
  the Zope 3.2.0 release.

- Removed deprecated helper functions, 'proxy.trustedRemoveSecurityProxy'
  and 'proxy.getProxiedObject'.

- Made handling of 'management.{end,restore}Interaction' more careful
  w.r.t. edge cases.

- Made behavior of 'canWrite' consistent with 'canAccess':  if 'canAccess'
  does not raise 'ForbiddenAttribute', then neither will 'canWrite'.  See:
  http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope3-dev/506

- Code style / documentation / test fixes.

zope.security version 3.1.0 (2005/10/03)
----------------------------------------

- Added support for use of the new Python 2.4 datatypes, 'set' and
  'frozenset', within checked code.

- C security proxy acquired a dependency on the 'proxy.h' header from the
  'zope.proxy' package.
  
  XXX: the spelling of the '#include' is bizarre!  It seems to be related
       to 'zpkg'-based builds, and should likely be revisited.  For the
       moment, I have linked in the 'zope.proxy' package into our own
       'include' directory.  See the subversion checkin:
       http://svn.zope.org/Zope3/?rev=37882&view=rev

- Updated checker to avoid re-proxying objects which have and explicit
  '__Security_checker__' assigned.

- Corresponds to the verison of the zope.security package shipped as part of
  the Zope 3.1.0 release.

- Clarified contract of 'IChecker' to indicate that its 'check*' methods
  may raise only 'Forbidden' or 'Unauthorized' exceptions.

- Added interfaces, ('IPrincipal', 'IGroupAwarePrincipal', 'IGroup', and
  'IPermission') specifying contracts of components in the security framework.

- Code style / documentation / test fixes.

zope.security version 3.0.0 (2004/11/07)
----------------------------------------

  the Zope X3.0.0 release.
