Possible errors and solutions
-----------------------------

While running buildout, you may get module import errors like this::

  ConfigurationError: ('Invalid value for', 'package', 'ImportError: Module zope.app has no global authentication')
  ConfigurationError: ('Invalid value for', 'package', 'ImportError: Module zope.app has no global broken')
  ConfigurationError: ('Invalid value for', 'package', 'ImportError: Module zope.app has no global error')
  ConfigurationError: ('Invalid value for', 'package', 'ImportError: Module zope.app has no global i18n')
  ConfigurationError: ('Invalid value for', 'package', 'ImportError: Module zope.app has no global session')
  ConfigurationError: ('Invalid value for', 'package', 'ImportError: Module zope.app has no global schema')
  ConfigurationError: ('Invalid value for', 'package', 'ImportError: Module zope.app has no global zopeappgenerations')
  ConfigurationError: ('Invalid value for', 'package', 'ImportError: Module zope.app has no global keyreference')
  ConfigurationError: ('Invalid value for', 'package', 'ImportError: Module zope.app has no global principalannotation')

**Solution**

Add the egg name (Eg:- ``zope.app.principalannotation``) to
``install_requires`` inside ``setup.py`` as given here.  Aftern
adding this, you need to run ``./bin/buildout`` command again.

::

  install_requires=['setuptools',
                    ...
                    'zope.app.authentication',
                    'zope.app.broken',
                    'zope.app.error',
                    'zope.app.i18n',
                    'zope.app.session',
                    'zope.app.schema',
                    'zope.app.zopeappgenerations',
                    'zope.app.keyreference',
                    'zope.app.principalannotation',
                    ...
                    ],

Another solution is to inlude egg name (Eg:-
``zope.app.principalannotation``) in the Buildout part where other
eggs are listed using``zc.recipe.egg`` recipe as given here::

  [app]
  recipe = zc.recipe.egg
  eggs = samplproject
         ...
         zope.app.authentication
         zope.app.broken
         zope.app.error
         zope.app.i18n
         zope.app.session
         zope.app.schema
         zope.app.zopeappgenerations
         zope.app.keyreference
         zope.app.principalannotation
  interpreter = breampy

Import error: ``zope.app.folder.interfaces.IFolder``

If you get error like this::

    ZopeXMLConfigurationError: File "/home/baiju/myapp/src/myapp/browser.zcml", line 21.2-27.8
    ConfigurationError: ('Invalid value for', 'for', "ImportError: Couldn't import zope.app.folder.interfaces, No module named folder.interfaces")

Open the ``browser.zcml`` file and look at line number 21, inside that ZCML declaration change:
``zope.app.folder.interfaces.IFolder`` to ``zope.site.interfaces.IFolder``.

If you get error like this::

  raise ValueError("Undefined permission id", permission_id)
  zope.configuration.config.ConfigurationExecutionError: <type 'exceptions.ValueError'>: ('Undefined permission id', 'zope.ManageApplication')

You need to include ``zope.applicationcontrol`` package in your ZCML
configuration file (``site.zcml``) as the permission definition is
available there.


If you are getting an error like this when accessing ``login.html`` view.

::

  .../eggs/zope.principalregistry-3.7.0-py2.5.egg/zope/principalregistry/principalregistry.py", 
  line 82, in unauthorized
     a = ILoginPassword(request)
  TypeError: ('Could not adapt', <zope.publisher.browser.BrowserRequest 
  instance URL=http://localhost:9060/@@login.html>, <InterfaceClass 
  zope.authentication.interfaces.ILoginPassword>)

You need to include ``zope.login`` package in your ZCML configuration
file (``site.zcml``) as the adapter registration is available there::

   <include package="zope.login" />

- Added tests for ternary if expression and for 'with' keyword and
  context managers.

transaction
~~~~~~~~~~~

1.1.1 (2010-09-16)
******************

Bug Fixes:

- Code in ``_transaction.py`` held on to local references to traceback
  objects after calling ``sys.exc_info()`` to get one, causing
  potential reference leakages.

- Fixed ``hexlify`` NameError in ``transaction._transaction.oid_repr``
  and add test.

1.1.0 (1010-05-12)
******************

New Features:

- Transaction managers and the transaction module can be used with the
  with statement to define transaction boundaries, as in::

     with transaction:
         ... do some things ...

  See transaction/tests/convenience.txt for more details.

- There is a new iterator function that automates dealing with
  transient errors (such as ZODB confict errors). For example, in::

     for attempt in transaction.attempts(5):
         with attempt:
             ... do some things ..

  If the work being done raises transient errors, the transaction will
  be retried up to 5 times.

  See transaction/tests/convenience.txt for more details.

Bugs fixed:

- Fixed a bug that caused extra commit calls to be made on data
  managers under certain special circumstances.

  https://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zodb-dev/2010-May/013329.html

- When threads were reused, transaction data could leak accross them,
  causing subtle application bugs.

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/239086

1.0.1 (2010-05-07)
******************

- LP #142464:  remove double newline between log entries:  it makes doing
  smarter formatting harder.

- Updated tests to remove use of deprecated ``zope.testing.doctest``.

1.0.0 (2009-07-24)
******************

* Fix test that incorrectly relied on the order of a list that was generated
  from a dict.

 * Remove crufty DEPENDENCIES.cfg left over from zpkg.

1.0a1 (2007-12-18)
******************

* Initial release, branched from ZODB trunk on 2007-11-08 (aka
  "3.9.0dev").

* Remove (deprecated) support for beforeCommitHook alias to
  addBeforeCommitHook.

* Add weakset tests.

* Remove unit tests that depend on ZODB.tests.utils from
  test_transaction (these are actually integration tests).

z3c.testsetup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0.8.3 (2010-09-15)
******************

- Fixed tests on windows related to testrunner problems with multiple
  layers run in subprocesses.

- Fixed some tests on windows, mostly because of path separator issues


0.8.2 (2010-07-30)
******************

- Fixed tests not to fail when some buildbot takes minutes to run the
  tests.

- Fix tests to work also under Python 2.7.

0.8.1 (2010-07-25)
******************

- The ``encoding`` parameter is ignored under Python 2.4. This was
  already true for the 0.8 release, but now we silently ignore it
  instead of raising exceptions. For Python >= 2.5 nothing changed.

0.8 (2010-07-24)
****************

- Use standard lib doctest instead of zope.testing.doctest.

- `z3c.testsetup` now looks in `zope.testrunner` for testrunner first
  (which was ripped out of `zope.testing`). Using testrunner from
  `zope.testing` is still supported. See bottom of ``testrunner.txt``
  in sources for details.

- Fix tests to stay compatible with more recent zope testrunners. This
  should us keep compatible with ZTK 1.0a2.

0.7 (2010-05-17)
****************

- Fix NameError bug in the warning message in case zope.app.testing is not
  availble when trying to run a functional doc test. This error presented
  itself as a highly cryptic ImportError when actually running tests.

0.6.1 (2009-11-19)
******************

- Test files that we attempt to read but that do not exist raise an error
  instead of passing silently.

- Internal refactoring: regex caching.

0.6 (2009-11-19)
****************

- Python unittest modules with an import error now result in a visible
  warning.  Previously, such problems would be hidden.  Also the python
  testrunner could not report them as broken as we did not pass those test
  files to the testrunner.

- Fixed regex for detecting the old ":test-layer: python" marker: it did not
  work when prefixed with restructuredtext's ".." comment marker.

0.5.1 (2009-10-22)
******************

* Reverted allow_teardown default back to False to prevent confusion.

0.5 (2009-09-23)
****************

Bug fixes
+++++++++

* Checkers are now applied to non-functional doctests too. Thanks to
  Jonathan Ballet for patches.

* Normal UnitTest layers are now registered correctly.

* ``:layer:`` now detects functional ZCML layers. If the defined layer is
  derived from `zope.testing.functional.ZCMLLayer`, then the test is
  set up with the same kind of testcase as ``:functional-zcml-layer:``.

* Reordered and cleaned up the documentation.

Feature changes
+++++++++++++++

* By default, functional layer tests now use the allow_teardown=True option of
  the ZCMLLayer.  This prevents the zcml layer from running in a subprocess
  which throws off profiling and thus code coverage tools.  Running it in a
  subprocess is only normally needed when you do things like adding an
  interface to a class after the fact in your code.  You can overrid it in the
  register_all_tests() call by setting allow_teardown=False.


0.4 (2009-06-11)
****************

Bug fixes
+++++++++

* Made ``z3c.testsetup`` selftests work with ``zope.testing`` >=
  3.7.3. Thanks to Jonathan Ballet for pointing to that problem.

* Ignore \*nix hidden test files (i.e. such starting with a dot in
  filename) by default. Thanks to Jonathan Ballet for patch.

* ZCML files registered via the default layer are now separated from
  each other, even if they own the same filename. Therefore you can now
  register a default layer with an ``ftesting.zcml`` in one subpackage
  while having another ``ftesting.zcml`` in another package. This was
  not handled correctly before. Many thanks go to Jonathan Ballet who
  contributed a patch.

Feature Changes
+++++++++++++++

* Added ``z3c.testsetup.testrunner`` that provides wrappers for
  ``zope.testing.testrunner``s ``run()`` and ``run_internal()``
  functions. Using it, one can make sure that running testrunners
  inside tests will work regardless of which version of
  ``zope.testing`` is used during testruns.

0.3 (2009-02-23)
****************

Bug fixes
+++++++++

* Updated doctest examples to reflect new ``zope.testing`` behaviour.

* ``z3c.testsetup`` really shouldn't require ``zope.app.testing`` any
  more. If you use it in an environment without this package, then you
  cannot register functional tests, which is determined when loading
  ``register_all_tests`` from ``z3c.testsetup``.

* Broken modules are ignored while scanning for tests.

* Modules are not loaded anymore if their source code does not provide
  a suitable marker string. For this to work, the default checker
  method ``isTestModule`` now expects a ``martian.scan.ModuleInfo`` as
  argument and not a real module. Module infos can be easily created
  by using ``module_info_from_dotted_name`` and
  ``module_info_from_package`` from the ``martian.scan`` package.

Feature Changes
+++++++++++++++

* New set of testfile markers:

  - `:doctest:`

    marks a testfile as a doctest.

  - `:unittest:`

    marks a testfile as a regular unittest.

  - `:layer: dotted.name.to.layer.def`

    applies the given layer definition to the tests in the doctest
    file.

  - `:zcml-layer: filename.zcml`

    sets up a ZCML layer with the given filename and applies this
    layer to the doctests in the doctest file.

  - `:functional-zcml-layer: filename.zcml`

    sets up a ZCML layer with the given filename and applies this
    layer to the doctests in the doctest file. Furthermore the tests
    are set up as functional doc tests.

  - `:setup: dotted.name.to.setup.function`

    applies the setUp function denoted by the dotted name to the tests
    in the doctest file.

  - `:teardown: dotted.name.to.teardown.function`

    applies the tearDown function denoted by the dotted name to the
    tests in the doctests file.

  See the examples in `tests/othercave` and README.txt to learn more
  about using these new directives.

  The old `:test-layer:` marker is still supported but it is
  deprecated now and will vanish at least with the 0.5 version of
  `z3c.testsetup`.

0.2.2 (2008-02-29)
******************

Bug fixes
+++++++++

* ``z3c.testsetup`` now does not require ``zope.component`` nor
  ``zope.app.testing`` for usage in other packages. You must take
  care, that those packages are available during tests, for example by
  adding those packages to your `setup.py`.

0.2.1 (2008-02-18)
******************

Bug fixes
+++++++++

* Fix faulty upload egg.

0.2 (2008-02-17)
****************

Feature Changes
+++++++++++++++

* An `ftesting.zcml` in the root of a handled package is now taken as
  default layer for functional doctests if it exists.

0.1 (2008-02-15)
****************

- Initial Release

zc.buildout
~~~~~~~~~~~

1.4.3 (2009-12-10)
******************

Bugs fixed:

- Using pre-detected setuptools version for easy_installing tgz files.  This
  prevents a recursion error when easy_installing an upgraded "distribute"
  tgz.  Note that setuptools did not have this recursion problem solely
  because it was packaged as an ``.egg``, which does not have to go through
  the easy_install step.


1.4.2 (2009-11-01)
******************

New Feature:

- Added a --distribute option to the bootstrap script, in order
  to use Distribute rather than Setuptools. By default, Setuptools
  is used.

Bugs fixed:

- While checking for new versions of setuptools and buildout itself,
  compare requirement locations instead of requirement objects.

- Incrementing didn't work properly when extending multiple files.
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zc.buildout/+bug/421022

- The download API computed MD5 checksums of text files wrong on Windows.

1.4.1 (2009-08-27)
******************

New Feature:

- Added a debug built-in recipe to make writing some tests easier.

Bugs fixed:

- (introduced in 1.4.0) option incrementing (-=) and decrementing (-=)
  didn't work in the buildout section.
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zc.buildout/+bug/420463

- Option incrementing and decrementing didn't work for options
  specified on the command line.

- Scripts generated with relative-paths enabled couldn't be
  symbolically linked to other locations and still work.

- Scripts run using generated interpreters didn't have __file__ set correctly.

- The standard Python -m option didn't work for custom interpreters.

1.4.0 (2009-08-26)
******************

- When doing variable substitutions, you can omit the section name to
  refer to a variable in the same section (e.g. ${:foo}).

- When doing variable substitution, you can use the special option,
  ``_buildout_section_name_`` to get the section name.  This is most handy
  for getting the current section name (e.g. ${:_buildout_section_name_}).

- A new special option, ``<`` allows sections to be used as macros.

- Added annotate command for annotated sections. Displays sections
  key-value pairs along with the value origin.

- Added a download API that handles the download cache, offline mode etc and
  is meant to be reused by recipes.

- Used the download API to allow caching of base configurations (specified by
  the buildout section's 'extends' option).

1.3.1 (2009-08-12)
******************

- Bug fixed: extras were ignored in some cases when versions were specified.

1.3.0 (2009-06-22)
******************

- Better Windows compatibility in test infrastructure.

- Now the bootstrap.py has an optional --version argument,
  that can be used to force zc.buildout version to use.

- ``zc.buildout.testing.buildoutSetUp`` installs a new handler in the
  python root logging facility. This handler is now removed during
  tear down as it might disturb other packages reusing buildout's
  testing infrastructure.

- fixed usage of 'relative_paths' keyword parameter on Windows

- Added an unload entry point for extensions.

- Fixed bug: when the relative paths option was used, relative paths
  could be inserted into sys.path if a relative path was used to run
  the generated script.

1.2.1 (2009-03-18)
******************

- Refactored generation of relative egg paths to generate simpler code.

1.2.0 (2009-03-17)
******************

- Added a relative_paths option to zc.buildout.easy_install.script to
  generate egg paths relative to the script they're used in.

1.1.2 (2009-03-16)
******************

- Added Python 2.6 support. Removed Python 2.3 support.

- Fixed remaining deprecation warnings under Python 2.6, both when running
  our tests and when using the package.

- Switched from using os.popen* to subprocess.Popen, to avoid a deprecation
  warning in Python 2.6.  See:

  http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#replacing-os-popen-os-popen2-os-popen3

- Made sure the 'redo_pyc' function and the doctest checkers work with Python
  executable paths containing spaces.

- Expand shell patterns when processing the list of paths in `develop`, e.g::

    [buildout]
    develop = ./local-checkouts/*

- Conditionally import and use hashlib.md5 when it's available instead
  of md5 module, which is deprecated in Python 2.6.

- Added Jython support for bootstrap, development bootstrap
  and zc.buildout support on Jython

- Fixed a bug that would cause buildout to break while computing a
  directory hash if it found a broken symlink (Launchpad #250573)

zc.lockfile
~~~~~~~~~~~

1.0.0 (2008-10-18)
******************

- Fixed a small bug in error logging.

1.0.0b1 (2007-07-18)
********************

Initial release

ZConfig
~~~~~~~

2.8.0 (2010-04-13)
******************

- Fix relative path recognition.
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zconfig/+bug/405687

- Added SMTP authentication support for email logger on Python 2.6.

2.7.1 (2009-06-13)
******************

- Improved documentation

- Fixed tests failures on windows.

2.7.0 (2009-06-11)
******************

- Added a convenience function, ``ZConfig.configureLoggers(text)`` for
  configuring loggers.

- Relaxed the requirement for a logger name in logger sections,
  allowing the logger section to be used for both root and non-root
  loggers.

2.6.1 (2008-12-05)
******************

- Fixed support for schema descriptions that override descriptions from a base
  schema.  If multiple base schema provide descriptions but the derived schema
  does not, the first base mentioned that provides a description wins.
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zconfig/+bug/259475

- Fixed compatibility bug with Python 2.5.0.

- No longer trigger deprecation warnings under Python 2.6.


2.6.0 (2008-09-03)
******************

- Added support for file rotation by time by specifying when and
  interval, rather than max-size, for log files.

- Removed dependency on setuptools from the setup.py.


zc.recipe.testrunner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.2.1 (2010-08-24)
******************

- Fixed a lot of windows issues
- Nailed versions to ZTK 1.0a2 (oh well, we have to have at least some stability)
- Fixed some other test failures that seemed to come from other packages

1.2.0 (2009-03-23)
******************

- Added a relative-paths option to use egg, test, and
  working-directory paths relative to the test script.

1.1.0 (2008-08-25)
******************

- Requiring at least zope.testing 3.6.0.

- Fixed a bug: Parallel runs of layers failed when using
  working-directory parameter.

zc.resourcelibrary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.3.1 (2010-03-24)
******************

- Resource libraries that are required during a retried request are now
  correctly registered and injected to the HTML.

- Import hooks functionality from zope.component after it was moved there from
  zope.site. This lifts the dependency on zope.site.

- Removed an unused ISite import and thereby, the undeclared dependency on
  zope.location.

1.3.0 (2009-10-08)
******************

- Use ``zope.browserresource`` instead of ``zope.app.publisher``, removing
  a dependency on latter.

- Look up the "resources view" via queryMultiAdapter instead of looking into
  the adapter registry.

- Moved the dependency on zope.site to the test dependencies.

1.2.0 (2009-06-04)
******************

- Use ``zope.site`` instead of ``zope.app.component``.  Removes direct
  dependency on ``zope.app.component``.

1.1.0 (2009-05-05)
******************

New features:

- An attempt to generate resource URLs using the "resources view" (@@)
  is now made; if unsuccesful, we fall back to the previous method of
  crafting the URL by hand from the site url. This ensures that the
  resource library respects the existing plugging points for resource
  publishing (see ``zope.app.publisher.browser.resources``).

- You can now explicitly specify where resource links should be
  inserted using the special marker comment '<!-- zc.resourcelibrary -->'.

1.0.2 (2009-01-27)
******************

- Remove zope.app.zapi from dependencies, substituting
  its uses with direct imports.

- Use zope-dev at zope.org mailing list address instead of
  zope3-dev at zope.org as the latter one is retired.

- Change "cheeseshop" to "pypi" in the package homepage.

zc.sourcefactory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0.6.0 (2009-08-15)
******************

- Change package homepage to PyPI instead of Subversion.

- Dropped Support for Zope 3.2 by removing a conditional import.

- Use hashlib for Python 2.5 and later to avoid deprecation warnings.


0.5.0 (2009-02-03)
******************

- FactoredContextualSourceBinder.__call__ now accepts arguments giving the
  args to pass to source class.  ContextualSourceFactory now uses a class
  variable to tell what kind of Source to make.

- Use zope.intid instead of zope.app.intid.

- Corrected e-mail address as zope3-dev@zope.org has been retired.

0.4.0 (2008-12-11)
******************

- Removed zope.app.form dependency. Changed ITerms import from
  zope.app.form.browser.interfaces to
  zope.browser.interfaces. [projekt01]


0.3.5 (2008-12-08)
******************

- Fixed bug in __new__ of contexual factories that would disallow
  subclasses to use constructors that expect a different
  signature. [icemac]


0.3.4 (2008-08-27)
******************

- Added all documents in package to long description, so they are
  readable in pypi. [icemac]

0.3.3 (2008-06-10)
******************

- Fixed bug in __new__ of factories that would disallow subclasses to use
  constructors that expect a different signature. (Thanks to Sebastian
  Wehrmann for the patch.)

0.3.2 (2008-04-09)
******************

- Fixed scalability bug caused by missing __nonzero__ on ValueMappingSource


0.3.1 (2008-02-12)
******************

- Fixed scalability bug caused by missing __nonzero__ on BasicSourceFactory

0.3.0
*****

- Added class-level defaults for attributes that are declared in the
  interfaces to not have the Zope 2 security machinery complain about
  them.

0.2.1 (2007-07-10)
******************

- Fixed a bug in the contextual token policy that was handling the
  resolution of values for a given token incorrectly.

0.2.0 (2007-07-10)
******************

- Added a contextual token policy interface that allows getToken and
  getValue to access the cotext for contextual sources.

- Added a contextual term policy interface that allows createTerm and
  getTitle to access the context for contextual sources.

- Added compatibility for Zope 3.2 and Zope 2.9 (via Five 1.3)

zdaemon
~~~~~~~

2.0.4 (2009-04-20)
******************

- Version 2.0.3 broke support for relative paths to the socket (``-s``
  option and ``socket-name`` parameter), now relative paths work again
  as in version 2.0.2.

- Fixed change log format, made table of contents nicer.

- Fixed author's email address.

- Removed zpkg stuff.


2.0.3 (2009-04-11)
******************

- Added support to bootstrap on Jython.

- If the run directory does not exist it will be created. This allow to use
  `/var/run/mydaemon` as run directory when /var/run is a tmpfs (LP #318118).

Bugs Fixed
++++++++++

- No longer uses a hardcoded filename (/tmp/demo.zdsock) in unit tests.
  This lets you run the tests on Python 2.4 and 2.5 simultaneously without
  spurious errors.

- make -h work again for both runner and control scripts.
  Help is now taken from the __doc__ of the options class users by
  the zdaemon script being run.

ZODB3
~~~~~

3.9.5 (2010-04-23)
******************

Bugs Fixed
++++++++++

- Fixed bug in cPickleCache's byte size estimation logic.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/533015)

- Fixed a serious bug that caused cache failures when run
  with Python optimization turned on.

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/544305

- Fixed a bug that caused savepoint rollback to not properly
  set object state when objects implemented _p_invalidate methods
  that reloaded ther state (unghostifiable objects).

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/428039

- cross-database wekrefs weren't handled correctly.

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/435547

- The mkzeoinst script was fixed to tell people to
  install and use the mkzeoinstance script. :)

3.9.4 (2009-12-14)
******************

Bugs Fixed
++++++++++

- A ZEO threading bug could cause transactions to read inconsistent
  data.  (This sometimes caused an AssertionError in
  Connection._setstate_noncurrent.)

- DemoStorage.loadBefore sometimes returned invalid data which
  would trigger AssertionErrors in ZODB.Connection.

- History support was broken when using stprages that work with ZODB
  3.8 and 3.9.

- zope.testing was an unnecessary non-testing dependency.

- Internal ZEO errors were logged at the INFO level, rather
  than at the error level.

- The FileStorage backup and restore script, repozo, gave a
  deprecation warning under Python 2.6.

- C Header files weren't installed correctly.

- The undo implementation was incorrect in ways that could cause
  subtle missbehaviors.

3.9.3 (2009-10-23)
******************

Bugs Fixed
++++++++++

- 2 BTree bugs, introduced by a bug fix in 3.9.0c2, sometimes caused
  deletion of keys to be improperly handled, resulting in data being
  available via iteraation but not item access.

3.9.2 (2009-10-13)
******************

Bugs Fixed
++++++++++

- ZEO manages a separate thread for client network IO.  It created
  this thread on import, which caused problems for applications that
  implemented daemon behavior by forking.  Now, the client thread
  isn't created until needed.

- File-storage pack clean-up tasks that can take a long time
  unnecessarily blocked other activity.

- In certain rare situations, ZEO client connections would hang during
  the initial connection setup.

3.9.1 (2009-10-01)
******************

Bugs Fixed
++++++++++

- Conflict errors committing blobs caused ZEO servers to stop committing
  transactions.

3.9.0 (2009-09-08)
******************

New Features (in more or less reverse chronological order)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- The Database class now has an ``xrefs`` keyword argument and a
  corresponding allow-implicit-cross-references configuration option.
  which default to true.  When set to false, cross-database references
  are disallowed.

- Added support for RelStorage.

- As a convenience, the connection root method for returning the root
  object can now *also* be used as an object with attributes mapped to
  the root-object keys.

- Databases have a new method, ``transaction``, that can be used with the
  Python (2.5 and later) ``with`` statement::

     db = ZODB.DB(...)
     with db.transaction() as conn:
          # ... do stuff with conn

  This uses a private transaction manager for the connection.
  If control exits the block without an error, the transaction is
  committed, otherwise, it is aborted.

- Convenience functions ZODB.connection and ZEO.connection provide a
  convenient way to open a connection to a database.  They open a
  database and return a connection to it. When the connection is
  closed, the database is closed as well.

- The ZODB.config databaseFrom... methods now support
  multi-databases. If multiple zodb sections are used to define
  multiple databases, the databases are connected in a multi-database
  arrangement and the first of the defined databases is returned.

- The zeopack script has gotten a number of improvements:

  - Simplified command-line interface. (The old interface is still
    supported, except that support for ZEO version 1 servers has been
    dropped.)

  - Multiple storages can be packed in sequence.

    - This simplifies pack scheduling on servers serving multiple
      databases.

    - All storages are packed to the same time.

  - You can now specify a time of day to pack to.

  - The script will now time out if it can't connect to s storage in
    60 seconds.

- The connection now estimates the object size based on its pickle size
  and informs the cache about size changes.

  The database got additional configurations options (`cache-size-bytes`
  and `historical-cache-size-bytes`) to limit the
  cache size based on the estimated total size of cached objects.
  The default values are 0 which has the interpretation "do not limit
  based on the total estimated size".
  There are corresponding methods to read and set the new configuration
  parameters.

- Connections now have a public ``opened`` attribute that is true when
  the connection is open, and false otherwise.  When true, it is the
  seconds since the epoch (time.time()) when the connection was
  opened. This is a renaming of the previous ``_opened`` private
  variable.

- FileStorage now supports blobs directly.

- You can now control whether FileStorages keep .old files when packing.

- POSKeyErrors are no longer logged by ZEO servers, because they are
  really client errors.

- A new storage interface, IExternalGC, to support external garbage
  collection, http://wiki.zope.org/ZODB/ExternalGC, has been defined
  and implemented for FileStorage and ClientStorage.

- As a small convenience (mainly for tests), you can now specify
  initial data as a string argument to the Blob constructor.

- ZEO Servers now provide an option, invalidation-age, that allows
  quick verification of ZEO clients have been disconnected for less
  than a given time even if the number of transactions the client
  hasn't seen exceeds the invalidation queue size. This is only
  recommended if the storage being served supports efficient iteration
  from a point near the end of the transaction history.

- The FileStorage iterator now handles large files better.  When
  iterating from a starting transaction near the end of the file, the
  iterator will scan backward from the end of the file to find the
  starting point.  This enhancement makes it practical to take
  advantage of the new storage server invalidation-age option.

- Previously, database connections were managed as a stack.  This
  tended to cause the same connection(s) to be used over and over.
  For example, the most used connection would typically be the only
  connection used.  In some rare situations, extra connections could
  be opened and end up on the top of the stack, causing extreme memory
  wastage.  Now, when connections are placed on the stack, they sink
  below existing connections that have more active objects.

- There is a new pool-timeout database configuration option to specify that
  connections unused after the given time interval should be garbage
  collection.  This will provide a means of dealing with extra
  connections that are created in rare circumstances and that would
  consume an unreasonable amount of memory.

- The Blob open method now supports a new mode, 'c', to open committed
  data for reading as an ordinary file, rather than as a blob file.
  The ordinary file may be used outside the current transaction and
  even after the blob's database connection has been closed.

- ClientStorage now provides blob cache management. When using
  non-shared blob directories, you can set a target cache size and the
  cache will periodically be reduced try to keep it below the target size.

  The client blob directory layout has changed.  If you have existing
  non-shared blob directories, you will have to remove them.

- ZODB 3.9 ZEO clients can connect to ZODB 3.8 servers.  ZODB ZEO clients
  from ZODB 3.2 on can connect to ZODB 3.9 servers.

- When a ZEO cache is stale and would need verification, a
  ZEO.interfaces.StaleCache event is published (to zope.event).
  Applications may handle this event and take action such as exiting
  the application without verifying the cache or starting cold.

- There's a new convenience function, ZEO.DB, for creating databases
  using ZEO Client Storages.  Just call ZEO.DB with the same arguments
  you would otherwise pass to ZEO.ClientStorage.ClientStorage::

    import ZEO
    db = ZEO.DB(('some_host', 8200))

- Object saves are a little faster

- When configuring storages in a storage server, the storage name now
  defaults to "1".  In the overwhelmingly common case that a single
  storage, the name can now be omitted.

- FileStorage now provides optional garbage collection.  A 'gc'
  keyword option can be passed to the pack method.  A false value
  prevents garbage collection.

- The FileStorage constructor now provides a boolean pack_gc option,
  which defaults to True, to control whether garbage collection is
  performed when packing by default. This can be overridden with the
  gc option to the pack method.

  The ZConfig configuration for FileStorage now includes a pack-gc
  option, corresponding to the pack_gc constructor argument.

- The FileStorage constructor now has a packer keyword argument that
  allows an alternative packer to be supplied.

  The ZConfig configuration for FileStorage now includes a packer
  option, corresponding to the packer constructor argument.

- MappingStorage now supports multi-version concurrency control and
  iteration and provides a better storage implementation example.

- DemoStorage has a number of new features:

  - The ability to use a separate storage, such as a file storage to
    store changes

  - Blob support

  - Multi-version concurrency control and iteration

  - Explicit support for demo-storage stacking via push and pop methods.

- Wen calling ZODB.DB to create a database, you can now pass a file
  name, rather than a storage to use a file storage.

- Added support for copying and recovery of blob storages:

  - Added a helper function, ZODB.blob.is_blob_record for testing whether
    a data record is for a blob.  This can be used when iterating over a
    storage to detect blob records so that blob data can be copied.

    In the future, we may want to build this into a blob-aware
    iteration interface, so that records get blob file attributes
    automatically.

  - Added the IBlobStorageRestoreable interfaces for blob storages
    that support recovery via a restoreBlob method.

  - Updated ZODB.blob.BlobStorage to implement
    IBlobStorageRestoreable and to have a copyTransactionsFrom method
    that also copies blob data.

- New `ClientStorage` configuration option `drop_cache_rather_verify`.
  If this option is true then the ZEO client cache is dropped instead of
  the long (unoptimized) verification. For large caches, setting this
  option can avoid effective down times in the order of hours when
  the connection to the ZEO server was interrupted for a longer time.

- Cleaned-up the storage iteration API and provided an iterator implementation
  for ZEO.

- Versions are no-longer supported.

- Document conflict resolution (see ZODB/ConflictResolution.txt).

- Support multi-database references in conflict resolution.

- Make it possible to examine oid and (in some situations) database
  name of persistent object references during conflict resolution.

- Moved the 'transaction' module out of ZODB.
  ZODB depends upon this module, but it must be installed separately.

- ZODB installation now requires setuptools.

- Added `offset` information to output of `fstail`
  script. Added test harness for this script.

- Added support for read-only, historical connections based
  on datetimes or serials (TIDs).  See
  src/ZODB/historical_connections.txt.

- Removed the ThreadedAsync module.

- Now depend on zc.lockfile

Bugs Fixed
++++++++++

- CVE-2009-2701: Fixed a vulnerability in ZEO storage servers when
  blobs are available. Someone with write access to a ZEO server
  configured to support blobs could read any file on the system
  readable by the server process and remove any file removable by the
  server process.

- BTrees (and TreeSets) kept references to internal keys.
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/294788

- BTree Sets and TreeSets don't support the standard set add method.
  (Now either add or the original insert method can be used to add an
  object to a BTree-based set.)

- The runzeo script didn't work without a configuration file.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/410571)

- Officially deprecated PersistentDict
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/400775)

- Calling __setstate__ on a persistent object could under certain
  uncommon cause the process to crash.

- When committing transactions involving blobs to ClientStorages with
  non-shared blob directories, a failure could occur in tpc_finish if
  there was insufficient disk space to copy the blob file or if the
  file wasn't available.  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/224169

- Savepoint blob data wasn't properly isolated. If multiple
  simultaneous savepoints in separate transactions modified the same
  blob, data from one savepoint would overwrite data for another.

- Savepoint blob data wasn't cleaned up after a transaction abort.
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/323067

- Opening a blob with modes 'r+' or 'a' would fail when the blob had no
  committed changes.

- PersistentList's sort method did not allow passing of keyword parameters.
  Changed its sort parameter list to match that of its (Python 2.4+)
  UserList base class.

- Certain ZEO server errors could cause a client to get into a state
  where it couldn't commit transactions.
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/374737

- Fixed vulnerabilities in the ZEO network protocol that allow:

  - CVE-2009-0668 Arbitrary Python code execution in ZODB ZEO storage servers
  - CVE-2009-0669 Authentication bypass in ZODB ZEO storage servers

  The vulnerabilities only apply if you are using ZEO to share a
  database among multiple applications or application instances and if
  untrusted clients are able to connect to your ZEO servers.

- Fixed the setup test command.  It previously depended on private
  functions in zope.testing.testrunner that don't exist any more.

- ZEO client threads were unnamed, making it hard to debug thread
  management.

- ZEO protocol 2 support was broken.  This caused very old clients to
  be unable to use new servers.

- zeopack was less flexible than it was before.  -h should default to
  local host.

- The "lawn" layout was being selected by default if the root of
  the blob directory happened to contain a hidden file or directory
  such as ".svn".  Now hidden files and directories are ignored
  when choosing the default layout.

- BlobStorage was not compatible with MVCC storages because the
  wrappers were being removed by each database connection.  Fixed.

- Saving indexes for large file storages failed (with the error:
  RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded).  This can cause a
  FileStorage to fail to start because it gets an error trying to save
  its index.

- Sizes of new objects weren't added to the object cache size
  estimation, causing the object-cache size limiting feature to let
  the cache grow too large when many objects were added.

- Deleted records weren't removed when packing file storages.

- Fixed analyze.py and added test.

- fixed Python 2.6 compatibility issue with ZEO/zeoserverlog.py

- using hashlib.sha1 if available in order to avoid DeprecationWarning
  under Python 2.6

- made runzeo -h work

- The monitor server didn't correctly report the actual number of
  clients.

- Packing could return spurious errors due to errors notifying
  disconnected clients of new database size statistics.

- Undo sometimes failed for FileStorages configured to support blobs.

- Starting ClientStorages sometimes failed with non-new but empty
  cache files.

- The history method on ZEO clients failed.

- Fix for bug #251037: Make packing of blob storages non-blocking.

- Fix for bug #220856: Completed implementation of ZEO authentication.

- Fix for bug #184057: Make initialisation of small ZEO client file cache
  sizes not fail.

- Fix for bug #184054: MappingStorage used to raise a KeyError during `load`
  instead of a POSKeyError.

- Fixed bug in Connection.TmpStore: load() would not defer to the backend
  storage for loading blobs.

- Fix for bug #181712: Make ClientStorage update `lastTransaction` directly
  after connecting to a server, even when no cache verification is necessary.

- Fixed bug in blob filesystem helper: the `isSecure` check was inverted.

- Fixed bug in transaction buffer: a tuple was unpacked incorrectly in
  `clear`.

- Bugfix the situation in which comparing persistent objects (for
  instance, as members in BTree set or keys of BTree) might cause data
  inconsistency during conflict resolution.

- Fixed bug 153316: persistent and BTrees were using `int`
  for memory sizes which caused errors on x86_64 Intel Xeon machines
  (using 64-bit Linux).

- Fixed small bug that the Connection.isReadOnly method didn't
  work after a savepoint.

- Bug #98275: Made ZEO cache more tolerant when invalidating current
  versions of objects.

- Fixed a serious bug that could cause client I/O to stop
  (hang). This was accompanied by a critical log message along the
  lines of: "RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration".

- Fixed bug #127182: Blobs were subclassable which was not desired.

- Fixed bug #126007: tpc_abort had untested code path that was
  broken.

- Fixed bug #129921: getSize() function in BlobStorage could not
  deal with garbage files

- Fixed bug in which MVCC would not work for blobs.

- Fixed bug in ClientCache that occurred with objects larger than the total
  cache size.

- When an error occured attempting to lock a file and logging of said error was
  enabled.

- FileStorages previously saved indexes after a certain
  number of writes.  This was done during the last phase of two-phase
  commit, which made this critical phase more subject to errors than
  it should have been.  Also, for large databases, saves were done so
  infrequently as to be useless.  The feature was removed to reduce
  the chance for errors during the last phase of two-phase commit.

- File storages previously kept an internal object id to
  transaction id mapping as an optimization. This mapping caused
  excessive memory usage and failures during the last phase of
  two-phase commit. This optimization has been removed.

- Refactored handling of invalidations on ZEO clients to fix
  a possible ordering problem for invalidation messages.

- On many systems, it was impossible to create more than 32K
  blobs. Added a new blob-directory layout to work around this
  limitation.

- Fixed bug that could lead to memory errors due to the use
  of a Python dictionary for a mapping that can grow large.

- Fixed bug #251037: Made packing of blob storages non-blocking.

- Fixed a bug that could cause InvalidObjectReference errors
  for objects that were explicitly added to a database if the object
  was modified after a savepoint that added the object.

- Fixed several bugs that caused ZEO cache corruption when connecting
  to servers. These bugs affected both persistent and non-persistent caches.

- Improved the the ZEO client shutdown support to try to
  avoid spurious errors on exit, especially for scripts, such as zeopack.

- Packing failed for databases containing cross-database references.

- Cross-database references to databases with empty names
  weren't constructed properly.

- The zeo client cache used an excessive amount of memory, causing applications
  with large caches to exhaust available memory.

- Fixed a number of bugs in the handling of persistent ZEO caches:

  - Cache records are written in several steps.  If a process exits
    after writing begins and before it is finishes, the cache will be
    corrupt on restart.  The way records are written was changed to
    make cache record updates atomic.

  - There was no lock file to prevent opening a cache multiple times
    at once, which would lead to corruption.  Persistent caches now
    use lock files, in the same way that file storages do.

  - A bug in the cache-opening logic led to cache failure in the
    unlikely event that a cache has no free blocks.

- When using ZEO Client Storages, Errors occured when trying to store
  objects too big to fit in the ZEO cache file.

- Fixed bug in blob filesystem helper: the `isSecure` check was inverted.

- Fixed bug in transaction buffer: a tuple was unpacked incorrectly in
  `clear`.

- Fixed bug in Connection.TmpStore: load() would not defer to the
  back-end storage for loading blobs.

- Fixed bug #190884: Wrong reference to `POSKeyError` caused NameError.

- Completed implementation of ZEO authentication. This fixes issue 220856.

(No changes)

zope.annotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.5.0 (2009-09-07)
******************

- Add ZODB3 to install_requires, because it's a true requirement of this

zope.app.applicationcontrol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.5.7 (2010-07-08)
******************

- 3.5.6 was a bad egg release.

3.5.6 (2010-07-07)
******************

- Bugfix: Launching ``svn`` replaced the whole environment instead of just
  appending ``LANG``.

3.5.5 (2010-01-09)
******************

- Extracted RuntimeInfo and ApplicationRoot functionality into
  zope.applicationcontrol. Import this functionality from this package
  instead (see BBB imports inside this package).

3.5.4 (2010-01-08)
******************

- Test dependency on zptpage removed.

3.5.3 (2010-01-05)
******************

- Updated to use newer zope.publisher 3.12 and zope.login to make
  tests work.

3.5.2 (2009-12-19)
******************

- Move 'zope.ManageApplication' permission from zope.app.security package

- Break dependency on ``zope.app.appsetup`` by using a conditional import

3.5.1 (2009-08-15)
******************

- Added missing (normal and test) dependencies.

- Renenabled functional tests.

3.5.0 (2009-05-23)
******************

- The application controller is now registered as a utility so that other
  packages like zope.traversing and zope.app.publication do not need
  to depend on this package directly.  This also makes the application
  controller pluggable.

zope.app.appsetup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.14.0 (2010-04-13)
*******************

- make zope.testing an optional (test) dependency.

- remove test dependency zope.app.testing.

3.13.0 (2009-12-24)
*******************

- Import hooks functionality from zope.component after it was moved there from
  zope.site.

- Import ISite from zope.component after it was moved there from
  zope.location. This lifts the dependency on zope.location.

- Added missing install dependency on `zope.testing`.

3.12.0 (2009-06-20)
*******************

- Using ``zope.processlifetime`` interfaces and implementations
  directly instead of BBB imports from ``zope.app.appsetup``.

- Got rid of depencency on ``zope.app.component``.

- Got rid of test dependency on ``zope.app.security``.

3.11 (2009-05-13)
*****************

- Event interfaces / implementations moved to ``zope.processlifetime``,
  version 1.0.  Depend on this package, and add BBB imports.

3.10.1 (2009-03-31)
*******************

- Fixed a ``DeprecationWarning`` introduced in 3.10.0.

- Added doctests to long description to show up at pypi.

3.10.0 (2009-03-19)
*******************

- Finally deprecate the "asObject" argument of helper functions in the
  ``zope.app.appsetup.bootstrap`` module. If your code uses any of these
  functions, please remove the "asObject=True" argument passing anywhere,
  because the support for that argument will be dropped soon.

- Move session utility bootstrapping logic from ``zope.session`` into this
  package. This removes a dependency from zope.session to this package.

- Remove one more deprecated function.

3.9.0 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Use ``zope.site`` instead of ``zope.app.folder`` and
  ``zope.app.component``.

- Use ``zope.container`` instead of ``zope.app.container``.

- Move error log bootstrapping logic from ``zope.error`` into this
  package.  This removes a dependency from zope.error to this
  package. Also added a test for bootstrapping the error log here,
  which was missing in ``zope.error``.

3.8.0 (2008-08-25)
******************

- Feature: Developed an entry point that allows you to quickly bring up an
  application instance for debugging purposes. (Implemented by Marius Gedminas
  and Stephan Richter.)

3.7.0 (2008-08-19)
******************

- Added ``.product.loadConfiguration`` test-support function; loads product
  configuration (only) from a file object, allowing test code (including
  setup) to make use of the same configuration schema support used by normal
  startup.

3.6.0 (2008-07-23)
******************

- Added additional test support functions to set the configuration for a
  single section, and save/restore the entire configuration.

3.5.0 (2008-06-17)
******************

- Added helper class for supporting product configuration tests.

- Added documentation for the product configuration API, with tests.

zope.app.authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.7.1 (2010-02-11)
******************

* Using the new `principalfactories.zcml` file, from ``zope.pluggableauth``,
  to avoid duplication errors, in the adapters registration.

3.7.0 (2010-02-08)
******************

* The Pluggable Authentication utility has been severed and released
  in a standalone package: `zope.pluggableauth`. We are now using this
  new package, providing backward compatibility imports to assure a
  smooth transition.

3.6.2 (2010-01-05)
******************

* Fix tests by using zope.login, and require new zope.publisher 3.12.

3.6.1 (2009-10-07)
******************

* Fix ftesting.zcml due to ``zope.securitypolicy`` update.

* Don't use ``zope.app.testing.ztapi`` in tests, use zope.component's
  testing functions instead.

* Fix functional tests and stop using port 8081. Redirecting to
  different port without trusted flag is not allowed.

3.6.0 (2009-03-14)
******************

* Separate the presentation template and camefrom/redirection logic for the
  ``loginForm.html`` view. Now the logic is contained in the
  ``zope.app.authentication.browser.loginform.LoginForm`` class.

* Fix login form redirection failure in some cases with Python 2.6.

* Use the new ``zope.authentication`` package instead of ``zope.app.security``. 

* The "Password Manager Names" vocabulary and simple password manager registry
  were moved to the ``zope.password`` package.

* Remove deprecated code.

3.5.0 (2009-03-06)
******************

* Split password manager functionality off to the new ``zope.password``
  package. Backward-compatibility imports are left in place.

* Use ``zope.site`` instead of ``zope.app.component``.

3.5.0a2 (2009-02-01)
********************

* Make old encoded passwords really work.

3.5.0a1 (2009-01-31)
********************

* Use ``zope.container`` instead of ``zope.app.container``.

* Encoded passwords are now stored with a prefix ({MD5}, {SHA1},
  {SSHA}) indicating the used encoding schema. Old (encoded) passwords
  can still be used.

* Add an SSHA password manager that is compatible with standard LDAP
  passwords. As this encoding gives better security agains dictionary
  attacks, users are encouraged to switch to this new password schema.

* InternalPrincipal now uses SSHA password manager by default.

zope.app.basicskin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.5.0 (2009-12-16)
******************

- Avoid extraneous testing dependencies and remove test extra.

- Avoid zope.app.component testing dependency.

- Removed BBB import for IBasicSkin.

3.4.1 (2009-08-15)
******************

- Added missing test dependency: zope.app.component.

zope.app.broken
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.5.0 (2009-02-05)
******************

- Depend on new ``zope.broken`` package for the ``IBroken`` interface.

zope.app.cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.7.0 (2009-07-25)
******************

- Use the RAM cache implementation from zope.ramcache.

3.6.0 (2009-05-27)
******************

- Use zope.componentvocabulary instead of zope.app.component.

3.5.0 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container.

zope.app.catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.8.1 (2010-01-08)
******************

- Removed unneeded dependencies on zope.app.publisher and zope.app.form, moved
  zope.app.intid to the test dependencies.

- Import hooks functionality from zope.component after it was moved there from
  zope.site. This lifts the test dependency on zope.site.

- Use new zope.publisher that requires zope.login.

3.8.0 (2009-02-01)
******************

- Move most of this package's code to new ``zope.catalog`` package,
  leaving only ZMI-related views and backward-compatibility imports
  here. 

3.7.0 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Change catalog's addMenuItem permission to zope.ManageServices
  as it doesn't make any sense to add an empty catalog that you
  can't modify with zope.ManageContent permission and it's completely
  useless without indexes. So there's no need to show a menu item.

- Replaced dependency on `zope.app.container` with a lighter-weight
  dependency upon the newly refactored `zope.container` package.

3.6.0 (2009-01-03)
******************

- Make TextIndex addform use default values as specified in
  zope.app.catalog.text.ITextIndex interface. Also, change
  "searchableText" to "getSearchableText" there, as it's the
  right value.

- Add Keyword (case-insensitive and case-sensitive) catalog
  indices. It's now possible to use them, because ones in
  zope.index now implement IIndexSearch interface.

- Add support for sorting, reversing and limiting result set
  in the ``searchResults`` method, using new IIndexSort interface
  features of zope.index.

3.5.2 (2008-12-28)
******************

- Remove testing dependencies from install_requires.

zope.app.component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.9.1 (2010-09-01)
******************

- No longer using deprecated ``zope.testing.doctest``. Use python's build-in
  ``doctest`` instead.

- Replaced the dependency on ``zope.deferredimport`` with BBB imports.

3.9.0 (2010-07-19)
******************

- Added missing BBB import in ``zope.app.component.metaconfigure``.

- Requiring at least ``zope.component`` 3.8 where some modules have
  moved which are BBB imported here.

3.8.4 (2010-01-08)
******************

- Import hooks functionality from zope.component after it was moved there from
  zope.site.

- Import ISite and IPossibleSite from zope.component after they were moved
  there from zope.location. This lifts the direct dependency on zope.location.

- Fix tests using a newer zope.publisher that requires zope.login.

3.8.3 (2009-07-11)
******************

- Removed unnecessary dependency on ``zope.app.interface``.

3.8.2 (2009-05-22)
******************

- Fix missing import in ``zope.app.component.metadirectives``.

3.8.1 (2009-05-21)
******************

- Add deprecation note.

3.8.0 (2009-05-21)
******************

- IMPORTANT: this package is now empty except for some ZMI definitions
  in zope.app.component.browser. Functionality from this package has
  been moved to ``zope.site``, ``zope.componentvocabulary`` and
  ``zope.component``, so preferably import from those locations.

- zope.componentvocabulary has the vocabulary implementations that
  were in zope.app.componentvocabulary now, import them from there for
  backwards compatibility.

- moved zope:resource and zope:view directive implementation and tests
  over into zope.component [zcml].

3.7.0 (2009-04-01)
******************

- Removed deprecated `zope:defaultView` directive and its
  implementation.  New directive to set default view is
  `browser:defaultView`.

3.6.1 (2009-03-12)
******************

- Make ``class`` directive schemas importable from old location,
  raising a deprecation warning. It was moved in the previous release,
  but some custom directives could possibly use its schemas.

- Deprecate import of ClassDirective to announce about new location.

- Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org,
  because zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired.

- Adapt to the move of IDefaultViewName from zope.component.interfaces
  to zope.publisher.interfaces.

3.6.0 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Moved the implementation of the <class> directive from this package to
  `zope.security`.  In particular, the module
  `zope.app.component.contentdirective` has moved to
  `zope.security.metaconfigure`, and a compatibility import has been
  left in its place.

- Extracted `zope.site` from zope.app.component with backwards
  compatibility imports in place. Local site related functionality
  is now in `zope.site` and packages should import from there.

- Remove more deprecated on 3.5 code:

  * zope.app.component.fields module that was pointing to the
    removed back35's LayerField.
  * zope.app.component.interface module that was moved to
    zope.component.interface ages ago.
  * zope:content and zope:localUtility directives.
  * zope:factory directive.
  * deprecated imports in zope.component.metaconfigure
  * browser:tool directive and all zope.component.browser
    meta.zcml stuff.

- Remove "back35" extras_require as it doesn't make
  any sense now.

- Remove zope.modulealias test dependency as it is
  not used anywhere.

- Deprecate ISite and IPossibleSite imports from
  zope.app.component.interfaces. They were moved
  to zope.location.interfaces ages ago. Fix imports
  in zope.app.component itself.

3.5.0 (2008-10-13)
******************

- Remove deprecated code slated for removal on 3.5.

zope.app.container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.9.1 (2010-09-14)
******************

- Removed a testing dependency on zope.app.file.

- Replaced a testing dependency on zope.app.securitypolicy with one on the base
  zope.securitypolicy distribution.

3.9.0 (2010-08-19)
******************

- Updated ``ftesting.zcml`` to use the new permission names exported by
  ``zope.dublincore`` 3.7.

3.8.2 (2010-01-08)
******************

- Fix tests using a newer zope.publisher that requires zope.login.

3.8.1 (2009-12-26)
******************

- Fixed test_directive. Some parts of zope.app.publisher were moved
  to zope.browsermenu and zope.browserpage.

- Moved tests/test_view_permissions.py to browser/tests.

- Added undeclared install dependency on ``zope.app.publisher``.

- Test no longer use deprecated ``zope.testing.doctestunit`` but
  python's ``doctest`` instead.

3.8.0 (2009-05-13)
******************

- Moved ``IAdding`` interface to ``zope.browser.interfaces``, leaving
  BBB imports.

3.7.2 (2009-03-12)
******************

- Show a "nothing to add" message instead of empty list in the
  adding view, if there's nothing to add.

- Don't show the "Add" menu item if there's nothing to add.

- Adapt to the removal of deprecated interfaces from
  ``zope.component.interfaces``. Now ``IAdding`` inherits from
  ``zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IBrowserView``.

3.7.1 (2009-02-05)
******************

- Updated test to accomodate "Pythonic" exception now raised from
  ``__setitem__`` provided by ``zope.container`` (``KeyError`` instead
  of ``zope.exceptions.UserError``).

3.7.0 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Remove long-time deprecated ``IContentContainer`` class.

- We now rely on a new package called ``zope.container``, which
  contains the basic implementation of ``zope.container`` and is
  intended to have less dependencies. We have gone through a wide
  range of packages and updated their dependencies to point to
  ``zope.container`` so that they will also have less indirect
  dependencies.

  For backwards compatibility we have left the original modules in
  ``zope.app.container`` in place and have placed imports to make sure
  the symbols exist in their original locations.

3.6.2 (2008-10-21)
******************

- Fixed bug in ``_zope_app_container_contained.c``.

3.6.1 (2008-10-15)
******************

- Reimplemented the ``BTreeContainer`` so that it directly accesses the btree
  methods (removed an old #TODO)

- Removed usage of deprecated ``LayerField``.

- Made C code compatible with Python 2.5 on 64bit architectures.

- Fixed bug: Error thrown during ``__setitem__`` for an ordered container
  leaves bad key in order

- Fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/238579,
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/163149: Error with unicode
  traversing

- Fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/221025: The Adding menu
  is sorted with translated item by using a collator (better localized
  sorting)

- Fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/227617:
    - prevent the namechooser from failing on '+', '@' and '/'
    - added tests in the namechooser
    - be sure the name chooser returns unicode

- Fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/175388: The setitem's
  size modification is now done in ``setitemf``: setting an existing
  item does not change the size, and the event subscribers should see
  the new size instead of the old size.

3.6.0 (2008-05-06)
******************

- Added an ``IBTreeContainer`` interface that allows an argument to the
  ``items``, ``keys``, and ``values`` methods with the same semantics as for
  a BTree object.  The extended interface is implemented by the
  ``BTreeContainer`` class.

3.5 (2007-10-11)
****************

- Updated bootstrap script to current version.

- Store length of ``BTreeContainer`` in its own ``Length`` object for faster
  ``__len__`` implementation of huge containers.

- Send ``IObjectModifiedEvent`` when changing the title through the
  ``@@contents.html`` view.
  This fixes https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/98483.

- Resolve ``ZopeSecurityPolicy`` and ``IRolePermissionManager`` deprecation

  required when no value is selected. See zope/app/form/browser/README.txt on
  how to switch this off for BBB.

- Source select widgets for required fields are now required as well. They
  used not to be required on the assumption that some value would be selected

- Remove dependency on `zope.app.testing` by using the
  `zope.app.wsgi.testlayer` support instead.

  At the time of this writing the test dependency on
  `zope.app.zcmlfiles` cannot be removed however, because there is a
  dependency on `zope.app.file` for testing, which pulls in the world.

   * The include of ``zope.i18n.locales`` was also moved into ``zope.i18n``.
   * The registration of IModifiableUserPreferredLanguages adapter was moved
     into ``zope.app.publisher``.

  moved to ``zope.i18n`` ages ago.

3.5.0 (2009-02-01)

  ZMI-related browser views here.
  
  Note, that if you used the ``exclude`` directive from ``zc.configuration``
  package to exclude the ``subscribers.zcml`` file from ``zope.app.intid``,
  you need to change the directive to exclude it from ``zope.intid`` now.

3.6.0 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Changed dependency from ``zope.app.container`` to
  ``zope.container``.

*****************

- Performance related change to the conflict resolution code in
  ``zope.app.keyreference.persistent.KeyReferenceToPersistent.__cmp__``.

  to persistent key references so that they can now, in many cases, allow
  conflict resolution when they are used as keys or set members in ZODB
  `BTrees` data structures.

- Move zope.testing to the "test" extra require, because it's only needed for testing.

3.4.0 (2007-10-24)

3.6.0 (2009-12-28)
******************

- Added `configure.zcml` which registers the translations in the

  done in `zope.app.zcmlfiles`.)


3.5.2 (2009-12-22)
******************

- Updated tests to handle Unicode correctly.

- Update Japanese Translation (thanks Takeshi Yamamoto).

  ``SimpleViewClass``. All of them where using old deprecated and
  removed Zope3 imports. None of them where used and tested.

- Use ``zope.container`` instead of ``zope.app.container``.

- Removed use of ``zope.app.zapi``.

zope.app.pagetemplate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.11.1 (2010-09-01)
*******************

- Add metaconfigure.registerType BBB import because some packages use it.

  allowed to remove the last outside zope.app dependencies.

- Fixed undeclared testing dependency on zope.app.component.

- Copy trivial NoTraverser class from zope.app.publication to avoid a ZCML
  dependency on that package.

- Correct testing dependency to point to zope.securitypolicy instead of its
  zope.app variant. The app version is no longer required since 3.4.1.

- Removed the ``inline-evaluation`` extra referring to zope.app.interpreter.
  There's no code or ZCML left pointing to that package.

3.7.1 (2009-05-27)
******************

- Restored ``zope.app.pagetemplate.engine`` module, using BBB imports from
  ``zope.pagetemplate.engine``.

3.7.0 (2009-05-25)
******************

- Moved the ``engine`` module and associated testing machinery to
  ``zope.pagetemplate`` (version 3.5.0).

3.6.0 (2009-05-18)

******************

- Fixed BBB imports which pointed to a not existing `zope.preferences`
  package.

  transaction.


3.6.1 (2009-03-31)
******************

  3.10. Ironically older versions now produce a ``DeprecationWarning``.


3.6.0 (2009-03-09)
******************

- Most of functionality is now moved to the ``zope.principalannotation``
  package. This package now only provides the bootstrap subscriber
  for the `zope3 application server` as well as browser menu item for
  adding PrincipalAnnotationUtility using ZMI.

3.5.1 (2009-03-06)
******************

- Make boostrap subscriber called on IDatabaseOpenedWithRootEvent
  instead of IDatabaseOpenedEvent, because this can cause bug if
  subscriber will be called before root object is created.

- Use zope.site instead of zope.app.component.

3.5.0 (2009-02-01)
******************

- Move boostrap subscriber to bootstrap.zcml file and browser
  menu item definition to browser.zcml file to ease overriding
  and excluding configuration.
- Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container.

*******************

- Don't depend on zope.app.testing and zope.app.zcmlfiles anymore in
  the tests.

3.10.2 (2010-01-08)
*******************

- Lift the test dependency on zope.app.zptpage.


3.10.1 (2010-01-08)
*******************

- make zope.testing an optional (test) dependency

- Fix tests using a newer zope.publisher that requires zope.login.

3.10.0 (2009-12-15)
*******************

- Moved EndRequestEvent and IEndRequestEvent to zope.publisher.

- Moved BeforeTraverseEvent and IBeforeTraverseEvent to zope.traversing.

- Removed dependency on zope.i18n.

- Import hooks functionality from zope.component after it was moved there from
  zope.site.

- Import ISite from zope.component after it was moved there from
  zope.location.

3.9.0 (2009-09-29)
******************

- An abort within handleExceptions could have failed without logging what
  caused the error. It now logs the original problem.

- Moved registration of and tests for two publication-specific event handlers
  here from zope.site in order to invert the package dependency.

- Declared the missing dependency on zope.location.

3.8.1 (2009-06-21)
******************

- Bug fix: The publication traverseName method used ProxyFactory
  rather than the publication proxy method.

3.8.0 (2009-06-20)
******************

- Added a proxy method that can be overridden in subclasses to control
  how/if security proxies are created.

- Replaced zope.deprecation dependency with backward-compatible imports

3.7.0 (2009-05-23)
******************

- Moved the publicationtraverse module to zope.traversing, removing the
  zope.app.publisher -> zope.app.publication dependency (which was a
  cycle).

- Moved IHTTPException to zope.publisher, removing the dependency
  on zope.app.http.

- Moved the DefaultViewName API from zope.app.publisher.browser to
  zope.publisher.defaultview, making it accessible to other packages
  that need it.

- Look up the application controller through a utility registration
  rather than a direct reference.

3.6.0 (2009-05-18)
******************

- Use ``zope:adapter`` ZCML directive instead of ``zope:view``.
  This avoid dependency on ``zope.app.component``.

- Update imports from ``zope.app.security`` to ``zope.authentication`` and
  ``zope.principalregistry``.

- Use ``zope.browser.interfaces.ISystemError`` to avoid dependency on
  ``zope.app.exception``.

- Refactored tests so they can run successfully with ZODB 3.8 and 3.9.

3.5.3 (2009-03-13)
******************

- Adapt to the removal of IXMLPresentation from zope.app.publisher which
  was removed to adapt to removal of deprecated interfaces from zope.component.

3.5.2 (2009-03-10)
******************

- Use ISkinnable.providedBy(request) instead of IBrowserRequest as condition
  for calling setDefaultSkin. This at the same time removes dependency to
  the browser part of zope.publisher.

- Remove deprecated code.

- Use built-in set class instead of the deprecated sets.Set and thus
  don't cause deprecation warning in Python 2.6.

3.5.1 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Import ISite from zope.location.interfaces instead of deprecated place
  in zope.app.component.interfaces.

3.5.0 (2008-10-09)
******************

- Now ``zope.app.publication.zopepublication.ZopePublication`` annotates the
  request with the connection to the main ZODB when ``getApplication`` is
  called.

- Removed support for non-existent Zope versions.


zope.app.publisher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.10.1 (2010-01-08)
*******************

- Fix tests using a newer zope.publisher that requires zope.login.

3.10.0 (2009-08-31)
*******************

- Fix test dependency on zope.container, now we depend on
  zope.container >= 3.9.
    

3.9.0 (2009-08-27)
******************

Refactor package, spliting it to several new packages:

   * ``zope.browserresource`` - the resources mechanism was moved here, see its
     CHANGES.txt for more information about changes during move.

   * ``zope.ptresource`` - the page template resource was moved into another
     package so zope.browserresource doesn't depend on any templating system.
     See zope.ptresource's CHANGES.txt for more information.

   * ``zope.browsermenu`` - the menu mechanism was moved here completely.
   
   * ``zope.browserpage`` - the browser:page directive and friends were
     moved here. Also, these directives don't depend hardly on menu system
     anymore, so they simply ignore the "menu" argument when zope.browsermenu
     is not available.
   
Backward-compatibility imports are provided, so there should not be much impact
for those who uses old imports.

The CacheableBrowserLanguages and ModifiableBrowserLanguages adapters were
moved into ``zope.publisher`` package, as well as browser:defaultSkin and
browser:defaultView ZCML directives and ZCML class configuration for
zope.publisher classes.

ZCML registrations of IXMLRPCPublisher adapters for zope.container were moved
into zope.container for now.


3.8.4 (2009-07-23)
******************

- Added dependency on ``zope.app.pagetemplate``, it is used by
  ``zope.app.publisher.browser.viewmeta``.

3.8.3 (2009-06-18)
******************

- Bugfix: Fix ``IAbsoluteURL`` for ``IResource`` configuration. The latest
  release was moving the url generation for resources to an adapter which was
  a good idea. But the adapter was configured for
  ``IDefaultBrowserLayer``. This means every existing project which dosen't
  use ``IDefaultBrowserLayer`` will get a wrong ``IAbsoluteURL`` adapter and
  is loosing the ``@@`` part in the resource url.


3.8.2 (2009-06-16)
******************

- Remove test dependency on ``zope.app.pagetemplate``.

- Calling a resource to get its URL now uses ``IAbsoluteURL``.

3.8.1 (2009-05-25)
******************

- Updated to use ``zope.pagetemplate.engine`` module (requires versino
  3.5.0 or later), instead of ``zope.app.pagetemplate`` precursor.

- Replaced ``zope.deprecation`` dependency with BBB imports

3.8.0 (2009-05-23)
******************

- There is no direct dependency on zope.app.component anymore (even in
  the tests).

- Moved the publicationtraverse module to zope.traversing, removing the
  zope.app.publisher -> zope.app.publication dependency (which was a
  cycle).

- Moved the DefaultViewName API from zope.app.publisher.browser to
  zope.publisher.defaultview, making it accessible to other packages
  that need it.

3.7.0 (2009-05-22)
******************

- Use zope.componentvocabulary instead of zope.app.component
  (except for tests and IBasicViewInformation).

- Use zope.browser for IAdding interface (instead of zope.app.container)

- Update references to ``zope.app.component.tests.views`` to point to the new
  locations in ``zope.component.testfiles.views``.

3.6.2 (2009-03-18)
******************

- Register ``IModifiableUserPreferredLanguages`` adapter in the ZCML
  configuration of ``zope.app.publisher.browser`` package. This was previously
  done by ``zope.app.i18n``.

3.6.1 (2009-03-12)
******************

- Remove deprecated code.

- Adapt to removal of deprecated interfaces from zope.component.interfaces.
  The IResource is now moved to zope.app.publisher.interfaces. The IView
  and IDefaultViewName is now in zope.publisher.interfaces. The IPresentation
  interface was removed completely.

3.6.0 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container.

- Use zope.site.folder instead of zope.app.folder.

3.5.3 (2009-01-27)
******************

- Finally removed <browser:skin> and <browser:layer> that were marked as
  deprecated in 2006/02.

3.5.2 (2008-12-06)
******************

- Added possibility to specify custom item class in menuItem, subMenuItem
  and addMenuItem directives using the ``item_class`` argument (LP #291865).

- Menu items registered with <browser:page/> were not re-registered after the
  first functional test layer ran. In any subsequent functional test layer the
  items where not availabe (introduced in 3.5.0a3).

- Added a hook to specify a different BaseURL for resources. This makes sense
  if you want to put resources on a Content Delivery Network. All you need to
  do is to register an named Adapter 'resource' that implements IAbsoluteURL.

3.5.1 (2008-10-13)
******************

- Removed usage of deprecated LayerField from zope.app.component.back35.

3.5.0 (2008-08-05)
******************

- Refactored code to provide more hooks when deriving code from this pacakge.

  * A resource's URL creation is now in its own method.

  * The resource class of factories can be overwritten.

  * The cache timeout value can now be set as a class or instance attribute.

3.5.0a4 (2007-12-28)
********************

- Backed out the changes for the controversial XML-RPC skin support.

3.5.0a3 (2007-11-27)
********************

- make it possible to override menus: this was not possible because new
  interfaces where created any time a menu with the same name was created.

- Resolve ``ZopeSecurityPolicy`` deprecation warning.

3.5.0a2 (2007-08-23)
********************

- <browser:defaultView> now accepts classes as well as interfaces.

3.5.0a1 (2007-08-21)
********************

- Added a `layer` attribute to `xmlrpc:view`. This works just like layers for
  `browser:view` etc. but uses the `IXMLRPCSkinType`.

zope.app.renderer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.5.1 (2009-07-21)
******************

- Require the new `roman` package, since docutils does not install it
  correctly.

3.5.0 (2009-01-17)
******************

- Adapted to docutils 0.5 for ReST rendering: get rid of the
  ZopeTranslator class, because docutils changed the way it
  uses translator so previous implementation doesn't work anymore.
  Instead, use publish_parts and join needed parts in the ``render``
  method of the renderer itself.

- Removed deprecated meta.zcml stuff and zpkg stuff.

- Replaced __used_for__ with zope.component.adapts calls.

zope.app.rotterdam
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.5.1 (2010-01-08)
******************

- Fix tests using a newer zope.publisher that requires zope.login.

3.5.0 (2009-02-01)
******************

- Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container.

zope.app.schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.5.0 (2008-12-16)
******************

- Remove deprecated ``vocabulary`` directive.
- Add test for component-based vocabulary registry.

zope.app.security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.7.5 (2010-01-08)
******************

- Move 'zope.ManageApplication' permission to zope.app.applicationcontrol

- Fix tests using a newer zope.publisher that requires zope.login.

3.7.3 (2009-11-29)
******************

- provide a clean zope setup and move zope.app.testing to a test dependency

- removed unused dependencies like ZODB3 etc. from install_requires

3.7.2 (2009-09-10)
******************

- Added data attribute to '_protections.zcml' for PersistentList
  and PersistentDict to accomodate UserList and UserDict behavior
  when they are proxied.

3.7.1 (2009-08-15)
******************

- Changed globalmodules.zcml to avoid making declarations for
  deprecated standard modules, to avoid deprecation warnings.

  Note that globalmodules.zcml should be avoided.  It's better to make
  declarations for only what you actually need to use.

3.7.0 (2009-03-14)
******************

- All interfaces, as well as some authentication-related helper classes and
  functions (checkPrincipal, PrincipalSource, PrincipalTerms, etc.) were moved
  into the new ``zope.authentication`` package. Backward-compatibility imports
  are provided.

- The "global principal registry" along with its zcml directives was moved into
  new "zope.principalregistry" package. Backward-compatibility imports are
  provided.

- The IPrincipal -> zope.publisher.interfaces.logginginfo.ILoggingInfo
  adapter was moved to ``zope.publisher``. Backward-compatibility import
  is provided.

- The PermissionsVocabulary and PermissionIdsVocabulary has been moved
  to the ``zope.security`` package. Backward-compatibility imports are
  provided.

- The registration of the "zope.Public" permission as well as some other
  common permissions, like "zope.View" have been moved to ``zope.security``.
  Its configure.zcml is now included by this package.

- The "protect" function is now a no-op and is not needed anymore, because
  zope.security now knows about i18n messages and __name__ and __parent__
  attributes and won't protect them by default.

- The addCheckerPublic was moved from zope.app.security.tests to
  zope.security.testing. Backward-compatibility import is provided.

- The ``LocalPermission`` class is now moved to new ``zope.app.localpermission``
  package. This package now only has backward-compatibility imports and
  zcml includes.

- Cleanup dependencies after refactorings. Also, don't depend on
  zope.app.testing for tests anymore.
  
- Update package's description to point about refactorings done.

3.6.2 (2009-03-10)
******************

- The `Allow`, `Deny` and `Unset` permission settings was preferred to
  be imported from ``zope.securitypolicy.interfaces`` for a long time
  and now they are completely moved there from ``zope.app.security.settings``
  as well as the ``PermissionSetting`` class. The only thing left for
  backward compatibility is the import of Allow/Unset/Deny constants if
  ``zope.securitypolicy`` is installed to allow unpickling of security
  settings.

3.6.1 (2009-03-09)
******************

- Depend on new ``zope.password`` package instead of ``zope.app.authentication``
  to get password managers for the authentication utility, thus remove
  dependency on ``zope.app.authentication``.

- Use template for AuthUtilitySearchView instead of ugly HTML
  constructing in the python code.

- Bug: The `sha` and `md5` modules has been deprecated in Python 2.6.
  Whenever the ZCML of this package was included when using Python 2.6,
  a deprecation warning had been raised stating that `md5` and `sha` have
  been deprecated. Provided a simple condition to check whether Python 2.6
  or later is installed by checking for the presense of `json` module
  thas was added only in Python 2.6 and thus optionally load the security
  declaration for `md5` and `sha`.

- Remove deprecated code, thus removing explicit dependency on
  zope.deprecation and zope.deferredimport.

- Cleanup code a bit, replace old __used_for__ statements by ``adapts``
  calls.

3.6.0 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Changed mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org, because
  zope3-dev is retired now. Changed "cheeseshop" to "pypi" in
  the package homepage.

- Moved the `protectclass` module to `zope.security` leaving only a
  compatibility module here that imports from the new location.

- Moved the <module> directive implementation to `zope.security`.

- Use `zope.container` instead of `zope.app.container`;.

3.5.3 (2008-12-11)
******************

- use zope.browser.interfaces.ITerms instead of
  `zope.app.form.browser.interfaces`.

zope.app.securitypolicy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.5.2 (2010-01-08)
******************

- Remove deprecated compatibility imports. Now, this package only
  contains ZMI views for zope.securitypolicy.

- Update package's description and mailing list address.

- Fix tests using a newer zope.publisher that requires zope.login.

3.5.1 (2009-01-27)
******************

- Added missing dependency for tests: zope.app.zcmlfiles

3.5.0 (2008-12-11)
******************

- use zope.browser.interfaces.ITerms instead of zope.app.form.browser.interfaces
  This version requires zope.app.form 3.7.0 or higher if you use the browser
  part of this package. (grant form)

- Substitute zope.app.zapi by direct calls to its wrapped apis. See bug 219302


zope.app.server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.5.0 (2009-12-19)
******************

- Use ``zope.password`` instead of ``zope.app.authentication``

- Depend on new ``zope.processlifetime`` implementations instead of
  using BBB imports from ``zope.app.appsetup``.


zope.app.session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.6.2 (2010-09-01)
******************

- Remove undeclared dependency on ``zope.deferredimport``.

3.6.1 (2010-02-06)
******************

- Include meta.zcml from zope.securitypolicy

3.6.0 (2009-02-01)
******************

- Use ``zope.site`` instead of ``zope.app.folder`` in tests.

3.5.2 (2009-01-27)
******************

- Fixed tearDown-Error in tests.

zope.app.skins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(No changes)

zope.app.testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.7.5 (2010-04-10)
******************

- Switch doctests to use the stdlib ``doctest`` module, rather than the
  deprecated ``zope.testing.doctest`` variant.

3.7.4 (2010-01-08)
******************

- Import hooks functionality from zope.component after it was moved there from
  zope.site.

- Import ISite from zope.component after it was moved there from
  zope.location. This lifts the dependency on zope.location.

- Fix tests using a newer zope.publisher that requires zope.login.

3.7.3 (2009-08-20)
******************

- Fixed tests for python 2.4 as well as python 2.5 and 2.6; the change in
  version 3.7.1 introduced test regressions in python 2.4.

3.7.2 (2009-07-24)
******************

- Adjusted tests after the referenced memory leak problem has been fixed in
  ``zope.component``.


3.7.1 (2009-07-21)
******************

- Fixed failing tests. The code revealed that the tests expected the wrong
  value.


3.7.0 (2009-06-19)
******************

- Depend on new ``zope.processlifetime`` interfaces instead of using
  BBB imports from ``zope.app.appsetup``.

- Removed unused dependency on ``zope.app.component``.


3.6.2 (2009-04-26)
******************

- Removed deprecated back35 module and loose the dependency on
  ``zope.deferredimport``.

- Adapt to ``zope.app.authentication`` refactoring. We depend on
  ``zope.password`` now instead.

- Adapt to latest ``zope.app.security`` refactoring. We don't need this
  package anymore.

3.6.1 (2009-03-12)
******************

- Use ISkinnable.providedBy(request) instead of IBrowserRequest as condition
  for calling setDefaultSkin in HTTPCaller. This at the same time removes
  dependency to the browser part of zope.publisher.

- Adapt to the move of IDefaultViewName from zope.component.interfaces
  to zope.publisher.interfaces.

- Remove the DEPENDENCIES.cfg file for zpkg.

3.6.0 (2009-02-01)
******************

- Fix AttributeError in ``zope.app.testing.setup.setUpTestAsModule``
  (when called without name argument).

- Use ``zope.container`` instead of ``zope.app.container``.

- Use ``zope.site`` instead of ``zope.app.folder`` and
  ``zope.app.component`` for some parts.

3.5.6 (2008-10-13)
******************

- Change argument variable name in provideAdapter to not conflict with
  buitin keyword in Python 2.6.

3.5.5 (2008-10-10)
******************

- Re-configured functional test setup to create test-specific instances
  of HTTPCaller to ensure that cookies are not shared by doctests
  in a test suite.

3.5.4 (2008-08-25)
******************

- Clean up some transaction management in the functional test setup.

3.5.3 (2008-08-22)
******************

- Fix isolation enforcement for product configuration around individual tests.

3.5.2 (2008-08-21)
******************

- Added missing dependency information in setup.py.

- Added missing import.

- Repair memory leak fix released in 3.4.3 to be more sane in the presence of
  generations.

3.5.1 (2008-08-20)
******************

- Correct Fred's "I'm a doofus" release.

3.5.0 (2008-08-20)
******************

- Add support for product-configuration as part of functional layers; this
  more closely mirrors the configuration order for normal operation.

zope.app.tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.6.0 (2009-02-01)
******************

- Converted from using zope.app.container to zope.container.

3.5.1 (2009-01-29)
******************

- Add compatibility for newer zope.traversing releases that require us
  to explicitly set up testing. This also works with older releases.

3.5.0 (2009-01-17)
******************

- Get rid of zope.app.zapi dependency, replacing its uses with
  direct imports.

- Clean up dependencies, move testing and rotterdam dependencies
  to extra requires.

- Fix mailing list address to zope-dev@zope.org instead of retired
  zope3-dev@zope.org. Change `cheeseshop` to `pypi` in the package
  url.

- Replace __used_for__ in adapters.py with zope.component.adapts
  calls to make more sense. 

- Remove obsolete zpkg files, zcml include file for mkzopeinstance-based
  installations, versions.txt that makes no sense now. 

zope.app.twisted
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.5.0 (2009-07-24)
******************

- Update tests to work with latest packages.

3.4.2 (2009-01-27)
******************

- Fix tests. Remove unused code.

- Add zope.testbrowser to testing dependencies for ZEO tests.

- Remove unneeded dependency on ZODB3.

- Remove dependency on zope.app.zapi, substituting its uses with direct
  imports.

- Change "cheeseshop" to "pypi" in the package homepage.

zope.app.undo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.5.0 (2009-02-01)
******************

- Adjusted tests so that basic objects and interfaces are pulled from
  `zope.site` and `zope.location` rather than `zope.app.component`.

zope.app.wsgi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.9.2 (2010-05-23)
******************

- Fixed test breakage due to changes in mechanize 0.2.0.

3.9.1 (2010-04-24)
******************

- Add support for testing XMLRPC using zope.app.wsgi.testlayer.

- Fix a bug in the status string handling in zope.app.wsgi.testlayer's
  FakeResponse.

3.9.0 (2010-04-19)
******************

- Return a FakeResponse object in zope.app.wsgi.testlayer.http,
  so it becomes easier to port over tests from zope.app.testing's
  HTTPCaller.

- X-Powered-By header is now stripped by zope.app.wsgi.testlayer as
  it is by zope.app.testing.

- Bugfix: initialize any <logger> defined in the config, as
  zope.app.server does. (Fixes #291147)

3.8.0 (2010-04-14)
******************

- zope.app.wsgi.testlayer is now a lot more compatible with
  the HTTPCaller() functionality in zope.app.testing, which it can
  replace:

  - same transaction behavior - pending transactions are committed
    before request and synchronized afterwards.

  - support for browser.handleErrors (for zope.testbrowser).

  - support for clear-text (non-base64) Basic authentication headers,
    which are easier to read in the tests (though not correct in
    actual HTTP traffic).

3.7.0 (2010-04-13)
******************

- Rewrite tests in order not to dependent on ``zope.app.testing`` and
  ``zope.app.zcmlfiles``.

- ``zope.app.wsgi.testlayer`` introduces new testing functionality that
  can replace the old functionality in ``zope.app.testing``. In addition,
  it supports using ``zope.testbrowser`` with WSGI directly (instead of
  relying on ``zope.app.testing``, which pulls in a lot of dependencies).

  The interesting parts are:

  * ``zope.app.wsgi.testlayer.BrowserLayer``: this sets up a minimal layer
    that allows you to use the new WSGI-enabled Browser.

  * ``zope.app.wsgi.testlayer.Browser``: this is a subclass of Browser from
    ``zope.testbrowser.browser``. Use it instead of
    ``zope.testbrowser.browser`` directly to use the test browser with WSGI.
    You need to use ``BrowserLayer`` with your tests for this to work.

  * ``zope.app.wsgi.testlayer.http``: this is the equivalent to the ``http()``
    function in ``zope.app.testing``. It allows low-level HTTP access
    through WSGI. You need to use ``BrowserLayer`` with your tests for
    this to work.


3.6.1 (2010-01-29)
******************

- Support product configuration sections in Zope configuration files.


3.6.0 (2009-06-20)
******************

- Import database events directly from ``zope.processlifetime``
  instead of using BBB imports in ``zope.app.appsetup``.

3.5.2 (2009-04-03)
******************

- The ``WSGIPublisherApplication`` uses now the ``ILoggingInfo`` concept given
  from zope.publisher.interfaces.logginginfo for log user infos usable for
  access logs. This allows you to implement your own access log user info
  message. See zope.publisher.interfaces.logginginfo.ILoggingInfo for more
  information.

3.5.1 (2009-03-31)
******************

- The ``WSGIPublisherApplication`` call now provides a user name
  in the environment meant for use in logs.

3.5.0 (2009-02-10)
******************

- Make devmode warning message more generic. We don't nesessary have the
  `etc/zope.conf` file nowadays when using buildout-based setups.

- Add an application factory for Paste. So Zope application can now be
  easily deployed with Paste .ini configuration like this::

    [app:main]
    use = egg:zope.app.wsgi
    config_file = %(here)s/zope.conf
    handle_errors = false

  The config_file is a required argument, however the handle_errors
  defaults to True if not specified. Setting it to False allows you to
  make WSGIPublisherApplication not handle exceptions itself but
  propagate them to an upper middleware, like WebError or something.

- The ``WSGIPublisherApplication`` constructor and ``getWSGIApplication``
  function now accept optional ``handle_errors`` argument, described
  above.

- Change mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org instead of retired
  one.

zope.app.xmlrpcintrospection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.5.1 (2010-02-06)
******************

- Fix test by including zope.login
- Include ftesting.zcml from zope.app.securitypolicy.browser.tests
- Include meta.zcml from zope.securitypolicy 

3.5.0 (2009-02-01)
******************

- Update ``zope.app.folder`` with ``zope.site``.

zope.app.zcmlfiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.7.0 (2009-12-28)
******************

- Use new ``zope.app.locales`` which has its own `configure.zcml`.

- No longer using ``zope.testing.doctestunit`` as it is deprecated
  now. Using python's ``doctest`` module.

3.6.1 (2009-12-16)
******************

- Removed reference to no longer existing configure.zcml from
  ``zope.app.pagetemplate.tests``.


3.6.0 (2009-07-11)
******************

- No longer depends on deprecated ``zope.app.interface`` but on
  ``zope.componentvocabulary``.


3.5.5 (2009-05-23)
******************

- Added missing dependencies, including ``zope.app.http`` and
  ``zope.app.applicationcontrol``.


3.5.4 (2009-05-18)
******************

- Added missing ``zope.app.exception`` dependency, as we include its ZCML.

- Added missing ``zope.app.testing`` test dependency to make tests pass.


3.5.3 (2009-02-04)
******************

- Added ``zope.app.broken`` dependency (we include its ZCML).

3.5.2 (2009-01-31)
******************

- We depended on ``zope.formlib`` but didn't include its configuration. Now
  it's included in ``configure.zcml``.

- We include ZCML of ``zope.app.error`` but didn't mention it as a dependency.

3.5.1 (2008-12-28)
******************

- Add include of ``zope.app.schema:configure.zcml``. Because component-based
  vocabularies are used everywhere and we need to import zope.app.schema
  somehow to make it work. This is needed because of removal of the include
  of zope.app.schema's meta.zcml in the previous release.

3.5.0 (2008-12-16)
******************

- Remove deprecated include of ``zope.app.component.browser:meta.zcml``.
- Remove deprecated include of ``zope.app.schema:meta.zcml``.

  ``zope.app.zopeappgenerations`` to ``zope.app.generations.utility``.

- Fixed author email and home page address.


zope.app.zptpage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.5.1 (2010-01-08)
******************

- Use ``zope.pagetemplate`` instead of ``zope.app.pagetemplate``.

- Fix tests using a newer zope.publisher that requires zope.login.

3.5.0 (2009-01-31)

******************

- Removed undeclared testing dependency on zope.testing.

3.7.0 (2009-03-14)
******************

provide a separate common interface definition for authentication utilities
without extra dependencies.

zope.broken
~~~~~~~~~~~

3.6.0 (2010-01-09)
******************

- The IBroken interface has been merged into the ZODB3 distribution. Import
  the interface from there, while providing a copy for backwards compatibility
  with older versions of the ZODB3.

3.5.0 (2009-02-04)
******************

- Created ``zope.broken`` to hold depended upon bits of ``zope.app.broken``.

zope.browser
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.3 (2010-04-30)
****************

- Removed test extra and zope.testing dependency.

1.2 (2009-05-18)
****************

- Moved ``ISystemErrorView`` interface here from
  ``zope.app.exception`` to break undesirable dependencies.

- Fixed home page and author's e-mail address.

- Added doctests to long_description.

1.1 (2009-05-13)
****************

  ``zope.publisher.interfaces`` to break undesirable dependencies.

0.5.0 (2008-12-11)
******************

- Moved ``ITerms`` interface here from ``zope.app.form.browser.interfaces``
  to break undesirable dependencies.

zope.browsermenu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.9.1 (2010-04-30)
******************

- Removed use of 'zope.testing.doctestunit' in favor of stdlib's 'doctest.

3.9.0 (2009-08-27)
******************

Initial release. This package was splitted off zope.app.publisher.

zope.browserpage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.12.2 (2010-05-24)
*******************

- Fixed unit tests broken under Python 2.4 by the switch to the standard
  library ``doctest`` module.

3.12.1 (2010-04-30)
*******************

- Prefer the standard library's ``doctest`` module to the one from
  ``zope.testing``.

3.12.0 (2010-04-26)
*******************

- Move the implementation of ``tales:expressiontype`` here from
  ``zope.app.pagetemplate``.

3.11.0 (2009-12-22)
*******************

- Also moved named template implementation from zope.app.pagetemplate here.

3.10.1 (2009-12-22)
*******************

- We need to depend on the untrustedpython extra of zope.security, since we
  import from zope.pagetemplate.engine.

3.10.0 (2009-12-22)
*******************

- Remove dependency on zope.app.pagetemplate by moving viewpagetemplatefile,
  simpleviewclass and metaconfigure.registerType into this package.

3.9.0 (2009-08-27)
******************

- Initial release. This package was split off from zope.app.publisher.

zope.browserresource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.10.3 (2010-04-30)
*******************

- Prefer the standard libraries doctest module to the one from zope.testing.

3.10.2 (2009-11-25)
*******************

- The previous release had a broken egg, sorry.


3.10.1 (2009-11-24)
*******************

- Import hooks functionality from zope.component after it was moved there from
  zope.site. This lifts the dependency on zope.site and thereby, ZODB.

- Import ISite and IPossibleSite from zope.component after they were moved
  there from zope.location.

3.10.0 (2009-09-25)
*******************

- Add an ability to forbid publishing of some files in the resource directory,
  this is done by fnmatch'ing the wildcards in the ``forbidden_names``class
  attribute of ``DirectoryResource``. By default, the ``.svn`` is in that
  attribute, so directories won't publish subversion system directory that can
  contain private information. 

3.9.0 (2009-08-27)
******************

Initial release. This package was splitted off zope.app.publisher as a part
of refactoring process.

Additional changes that are made during refactoring:

 * Resource class for file resources are now selected the pluggable way.
   The resource directory publisher and browser:resource ZCML directive
   now creating file resources using factory utility lookup based on the
   file extension, so it's now possible to add new resource types without
   introducing new ZCML directives and they will work inside resource
   directories as well.
   
   NOTE: the "resource_factories" attribute from the DirectoryResource
   was removed, so if you were using this attribute for changing resource
   classes for some file extensions, you need to migrate your code to new
   utility-based mechanism.

   See zope.browserresource.interfaces.IResourceFactoryFactory interface.

 * The Image resource class was removed, as they are actually simple files.
   To migrate, simply rename the "image" argument in browser:resource and
   browser:i18n-resource directives to "file", if you don't do this, resouces
   will work, but you'll get deprecation warnings.
 
   If you need custom behaviour for images, you can register a resource
   factory utility for needed file extensions.

 * The PageTemplateResource was moved into a separate package, "zope.ptresource",
   which is a plugin for this package now. Because of that, the "template"
   argument of browser:resource directive was deprecated and you should rename
   it to "file" to migrate. The PageTemplateResource will be created for
   "pt", "zpt" and "html" files automatically, if zope.ptresource package is
   included in your configuration.

 * Fix stripping the "I" from an interface name for icon title, if no
   title is specified.

 * When publishing a resource via Resources view, set resource parent
   to an ISite object, not to current site manager.

 * Clean up code and improve test coverage.

zope.cachedescriptors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.5.1 (2010-04-30)
******************

- Removed undeclared testing dependency on zope.testing.

3.5.0 (2009-02-10)
******************

- Remove dependency on ZODB by allowing to specify storage factory for
  ``zope.cachedescriptors.method.cachedIn`` which is now `dict` by default.
  If you need to use BTree instead, you must pass it as `factory` argument
  to the ``zope.cachedescriptors.method.cachedIn`` decorator.

- Remove zpkg-related file.

- Clean up package description and documentation a bit.

- Change package mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org, as
  zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired.

3.4.0 (2007-08-30)
******************

Initial release as an independent package

zope.catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.8.1 (2009-12-27)
******************

- Removed ``zope.app.testing`` dependency.

3.8.0 (2009-02-01)
******************

- Move core functionality from ``zope.app.catalog`` to this package.
  The ``zope.app.catalog`` package now only contains ZMI-related browser
  views and backward-compatibility imports.

zope.component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.9.5 (2010-07-09)
******************

- Fix test requirements specification.

3.9.4 (2010-04-30)
******************

- Prefer the standard libraries doctest module to the one from zope.testing.

3.9.3 (2010-03-08)
******************

- The ZCML directives provided by zope.component now register the components in
  the registry returned by getSiteManager instead of the global registry. This
  allows the hooking of the getSiteManager method before the load of a ZCML
  file to register the components in a custom registry.

3.9.2 (2010-01-22)
******************

- Fixed a bug introduced by recent refactoring, where passing
  CheckerPublic to securityAdapterFactory wrongly wrapped the factory
  into a LocatingUntrustedAdapterFactory.

3.9.1 (2010-01-21)
******************

- The tested testrunner somehow gets influenced by options of the outer
  testrunner, such a the -v option. We modified the tests so that it avoids
  this.

3.9.0 (2010-01-21)
******************

- Add testlayer support. It is now possible to load a ZCML file within
  tests more easily. See zope.component.testlayer.py and
  zope.component.testlayer.txt.

3.8.0 (2009-11-16)
******************

- Removed the dependencies on zope.proxy and zope.security from the zcml extra:
  zope.component does not hard depend on them anymore; the support for security
  proxied components ZCML registrations is enabled only if zope.security and
  zope.proxy are available.

- Moved the IPossibleSite and ISite interfaces here from zope.location as they
  are dealing with zope.component's concept of a site, but not with location.

- Moved the zope.site.hooks functionality to zope.component.hooks as it isn't
  actually dealing with zope.site's concept of a site.

3.7.1 (2009-07-24)
******************

- Fixed a problem, where ``queryNextUtility`` could fail if the context could
  not be adapted to a ``IComponentLookup``.

- Fixed 2 related bugs:

  When a utility is registered and there was previously a utility
  registered for the same interface and name, then the old utility is
  unregistered.  The 2 bugs related to this:

  - There was no ``Unregistered`` for the implicit unregistration. Now
    there is.

  - The old utility was still held and returned by
    getAllUtilitiesRegisteredFor.  In other words, it was still
    considered registered, eeven though it wasn't.  A particularly
    negative consequence of this is that the utility is held in memory
    or in the database even though it isn't used.

3.7.0 (2009-05-21)
******************

- The HookableTests were not run by the testrunner.

- Add in zope:view and zope:resource implementations into
  zope.component.zcml (dependency loaded with zope.component [zcml]).

3.6.0 (2009-03-12)
******************

- IMPORTANT: the interfaces that were defined in the
  zope.component.bbb.interfaces and deprecated for years are
  now (re)moved. However, some packages, including part of zope
  framework were still using those interfaces. They will be adapted
  for this change. If you were using some of those interfaces, you
  need to adapt your code as well:

   - The IView and IDefaultViewName were moved to zope.publisher.interfaces.

   - The IResource was moved to zope.app.publisher.interfaces.

   - IContextDependent, IPresentation, IPresentationRequest,
     IResourceFactory, IViewFactory were removed completely.

     If you used IViewFactory in context of zope.app.form, there's now
     IWidgetFactory in the zope.app.form.interfaces instead.

- Add getNextUtility/queryNextUtility functions that used to be in zope.site
  earlier (and in zope.app.component even more earlier).

- Added a pure-Python 'hookable' implementation, for use when
  'zope.hookable' is not present.

- Removed use of 'zope.deferredimport' by breaking import cycles.

- Cleanup package documentation and changelog a bit. Add sphinx-based
  documentation building command to the buildout.

- Remove deprecated code.

- Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org, because
  zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired.

3.5.1 (2008-07-25)
******************

- Fix bug introduced in 3.5.0: <utility factory="..."> no longer supported
  interfaces declared in Python and always wanted an explicit provides="..."
  attribute. https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/251865

3.5.0 (2008-07-25)
******************

- Support registration of utilities via factories through the component registry
  and return factory information in the registration information. This fixes
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/240631

- Optimized un/registerUtility via storing an optimized data structure for
  efficient retrieval of already registered utilities. This avoids looping over
  all utilities when registering a new one.

zope.componentvocabulary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.0 (2009-05-19)
****************

* Initial public release, derived from zope.app.component and
  zope.app.interface to replace them.

zope.configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.7.2 (2010-04-30)
******************

- Prefer the standard libraries doctest module over zope.testing.doctest.

3.7.1 (2010-01-05)
******************

- Jython support: use __builtin__ module import rather than assuming
  __builtins__ is available

- Jython support: deal with the fact that the Jython SAX parser
  returns attribute sets that have an empty string indicating no
  namespace instead of ``None``.

- Allow ``setup.py test`` to run at least a subset of the tests that
  would be run when using the zope testrunner: ``setup.py test`` runs
  53 tests, while ``bin/test`` runs 156.

3.7.0 (2009-12-22)
******************

- Adjust testing output to newer zope.schema.

- Prefer zope.testing.doctest over doctestunit.

3.6.0 (2009-04-01)
******************

- Removed dependency of `zope.deprecation` package.

- Don't suppress deprecation warnings any more in 'zope.configuration'
  package level. This makes it more likely other packages will generate
  deprecation warnings now, which will allow us to remove more
  outdated ones.

- Don't fail when zope.testing is not installed.

- Added missing ``processFile`` method to ``IConfigurationContext``.
  It is already implemented in the mix-in class,
  ``zope.configuration.config.ConfigurationContext``, and used by
  implementations of ``include`` and ``exclude`` directives.

3.5.0 (2009-02-26)
******************

- Added the ``exclude`` directive to standard directives. It was
  previously available via ``zc.configuration`` package and now it's
  merged into ``zope.configuration``.

- Changed package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org,
  change "cheeseshop" to "pypi" in the package's url.

3.4.1 (2008-12-11)
******************

- Use built-in 'set' type, rather than importin the 'sets' module,
  which is deprecated in Python 2.6.

- Added support to bootstrap on Jython.

zope.container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.11.0 (2009-12-31)
*******************

- Copy two trivial classes from zope.cachedescriptors into this package, which
  allows us to remove that dependency. We didn't actually use any caching
  properties as the dependency suggested.

3.10.1 (2009-12-29)
*******************

- Moved zope.copypastemove related tests into that package.

- Removed no longer used zcml prefix from the configure file.

- Stop importing DocTestSuite from zope.testing.doctestunit. Fixes
  compatibility problems with zope.testing 3.8.4.

3.10.0 (2009-12-15)
*******************

- Break testing dependency on zope.app.testing.

- Break testing dependency on zope.app.dependable by moving the code and tests
  into that package.

- Import ISite from zope.component after it was moved there from
  zope.location.

3.9.1 (2009-10-18)
******************

- Rerelease 3.9.0 as it had a broken Windows 2.6 egg.

- Marked as part of the ZTK.

3.9.0 (2009-08-28)
******************

- Previous releases should be versioned 3.9.0 as they are not pure bugfix
  releases and worth a "feature" release, increasing feature version.
  
  Packages that depend on any changes introduced in version 3.8.2 or 3.8.3
  should depend on version 3.9 or greater.

3.8.3 (2009-08-27)
******************

- Move IXMLRPCPublisher ZCML registrations for containers from
  zope.app.publisher.xmlrpc to zope.container for now.

3.8.2 (2009-05-17)
******************

- Rid ourselves of ``IContained`` interface.  This interface was moved
  to ``zope.location.interfaces``.  A b/w compat import still exists
  to keep old code running.  Depend on ``zope.location``>=3.5.4.

- Rid ourselves of the implementations of ``IObjectMovedEvent``,
  ``IObjectAddedEvent``, ``IObjectRemovedEvent`` interfaces and
  ``ObjectMovedEvent``, ``ObjectAddedEvent`` and
  ``ObjectRemovedEvent`` classes.  B/w compat imports still exist.
  All of these were moved to ``zope.lifecycleevent``. Depend on
  ``zope.lifecycleevent``>=3.5.2.

- Fix a bug in OrderedContainer where trying to set the value for a
  key that already exists (duplication error) would actually delete the
  key from the order, leaving a dangling reference.

- Partially break dependency on ``zope.traversing`` by disusing
  zope.traversing.api.getPath in favor of using
  ILocationInfo(object).getPath().  The rest of the runtime
  dependencies on zope.traversing are currently interface
  dependencies.

- Break runtime dependency on ``zope.app.dependable`` by using a zcml
  condition on the qsubscriber ZCML directive that registers the
  CheckDependency handler for IObjectRemovedEvent.  If
  ``zope.app.dependable`` is not installed, this subscriber will never
  be registered.  ``zope.app.dependable`` is now a testing dependency
  only.

3.8.1 (2009-04-03)
******************

- Fixed misspackaged 3.8.0


3.8.0 (2009-04-03)
******************

- Change configure.zcml to not depend on zope.app.component.
  Fixes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/348329

- Moved the declaration of ``IOrderedContainer.updateOrder``  to a new, basic
  ``IOrdered`` interface and let ``IOrderedContainer`` inherit it. This allows
  easier reuse of the declaration.

3.7.2 (2009-03-12)
******************

- Fix: added missing ComponentLookupError, missing since revision 95429 and 
  missing in last release.

- Adapt to the move of IDefaultViewName from zope.component.interfaces
  to zope.publisher.interfaces.

- Add support for reserved names for containers. To specify reserved
  names for some container, you need to provide an adapter from the
  container to the ``zope.container.interfaces.IReservedNames`` interface.
  The default NameChooser is now also aware of reserved names.

3.7.1 (2009-02-05)
******************

- Raise more "Pythonic" errors from ``__setitem__``, losing the dependency
  on ``zope.exceptions``:

  o ``zope.exceptions.DuplicationError`` -> ``KeyError``

  o ``zope.exceptions.UserError`` -> ``ValueError``

- Moved import of ``IBroken`` interface to use new ``zope.broken``
  package, which has no dependencies beyond ``zope.interface``.

- Made ``test`` part pull in the extra test requirements of this package.

- Split the ``z3c.recipe.compattest`` configuration out into a new file,
  ``compat.cfg``, to reduce the burden of doing standard unit tests.

- Stripped out bogus develop eggs from ``buildout.cfg``.

3.7.0 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Split this package off ``zope.app.container``. This package is
  intended to have far less dependencies than ``zope.app.container``.

- This package also contains the container implementation that
  used to be in ``zope.app.folder``.

zope.contentprovider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.6.1 (2009-12-23)
******************

- Ensure that our configure.zcml can be loaded without requiring further
  dependencies. It uses a ``tales:expressiontype`` directive defined in
  zope.app.pagetemplate. We keep that dependency optional, as not all consumers
  of this package use ZCML to configure the expression type.

3.6.0 (2009-12-22)
******************

- Updated test dependency to use zope.browserpage.

3.5.0 (2009-03-18)
******************

- Add very simple, but useful base class for implementing content
  providers, see ``zope.contentprovider.provider.ContentProviderBase``.

- Remove unneeded testing dependencies. We only need zope.testing and
  zope.app.pagetemplate.

- Remove zcml slug and old zpkg-related files.

- Added setuptools dependency to setup.py.

- Clean up package's description and documentation a bit. Remove
  duplicate text in README.

- Change mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org instead of
  retired one.

- Change ``cheeseshop`` to ``pypi`` in the package url.

zope.contenttype
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.5.1 (2010-03-23)
******************

* LP #242321:  fix IndexError raised when testing strings consisting
  solely of leading whitespace.

* Updated mime-type for .js to be application/javascript.

3.5.0 (2009-10-22)
******************

* Moved the implementation of zope.publisher.contenttype to
  zope.contenttype.parse, moved tests along.

3.4.3 (2009-12-28)
******************
* Updated mime-type for .js to be application/javascript.

3.4.2 (2009-05-28)
******************

* Added MS Office 12 types
  based on:
  http://www.therightstuff.de/2006/12/16/Office+2007+File+Icons+For+Windows+SharePoint+Services+20+And+SharePoint+Portal+Server+2003.aspx

3.4.1 (2009-02-04)
******************

* Improved text_type(). Based on the patch from
  http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/2355/

* Add missing setuptools dependency to setup.py.

* Added reference documentation.

zope.copy
~~~~~~~~~

3.5.0 (2009-02-09)
******************

- Initial release. The functionality was extracted from ``zc.copy`` to
  provide a generic object copying mechanism with minimal dependencies.

zope.copypastemove
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.6.0 (2009-12-16)
******************

- Use zope.principalannotation in favor of its app variant.

- Avoid zope.app.component and testing dependencies.

3.5.2 (2009-08-15)
******************

- Fix documentation for the IObjectCopier.copyTo method.

- Added missing dependency on zope.app.component.

3.5.1 (2009-02-09)
******************

- Use the new zope.copy package for ObjectCopier to provide pluggable
  copying mechanism that is not dependent on zope.location hardly.

- Move the ItemNotFoundError exception to the interfaces module as
  it's part of public API. Old import still works as we actually
  use it where it was previously defined, however, the new import
  place is preferred.

3.5.0 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container.

3.4.1 (2009-01-26)
******************

- Moved the test dependencies to a `test` extra requirement.

zope.datetime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(No changes)

zope.deferredimport
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.5.0 (2009-02-04)
******************

- Added support to bootstrap on Jython.

- Added reference documentation.

zope.deprecation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(No changes)

zope.documenttemplate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.4.2 (2008/10/10)
******************

- Re-release 3.4.1

3.4.1 (2008/10/10)
******************

- Fixed usage of 'with' as a variable name. It is now a keyword in
  Python 2.6, causing a SyntaxError. ``zope.documenttemplate`` now
  supports Python 2.6.

zope.dottedname
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.4.6 (2009-09-15)
******************

- Make tests pass on python26.

3.4.5 (2009-01-27)
******************

- Move README.txt in the egg, so tests works with the released egg as well.

3.4.4 (2009-01-27)
******************

- Fix ReST in README.txt, fix broken tests with recent zope.testing.

3.4.3 (2008-12-02)
******************

- More documentation and tests.

zope.dublincore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.7.0 (2010-08-19)
******************

- Removed backward-compatibility shims for deprecated ``zope.app.dublincore.*``
  permissions.

- Removed include the zcml configuration of ``zope.dublincore.browser``.

- Using python`s doctest instead of deprecated ``zope.testing.doctest``.

3.6.0 (2009-12-02)
******************

- Removed the marker interface IZopeDublinCoreAnnotatable which doesn't seem
  to be used.

- Made the registration of ZDCAnnotatableAdapter conditional, lifting the
  dependency on zope.annotation and thereby the ZODB, leaving it as a test
  dependency.

3.5.0 (2009-09-15)
******************

- Add missing dependencies.

- Get rid of any testing dependencies beyond zope.testing.

- Include browser ZCML configuration only if zope.browserpage is installed.

- Specify i18n domain in package's ``configure.zcml``, because we use message
  IDs for permission titles.

- Remove unused imports, fix one test that was inactive because of being
  overriden by another one by a mistake.

3.4.2 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Declare dependency on zope.datetime.

3.4.1 (2009-01-26)
******************

- Test dependencies are declared in a `test` extra now.

- Fix: Make CreatorAnnotator not to fail if participation principal is None

zope.error
~~~~~~~~~~

3.7.0 (2009-09-29)
******************

- Clean up dependencies. Drop all testing dependencies as we only need
  zope.testing now.

- Fix ImportError when zope.testing is not available for some reason.

- Remove zcml slug and old zpkg-related files.

- Remove word "version" from changelog entries.

- Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org as
  zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired. Also change `cheeseshop` to
  `pypi` in the package's homepage url.

- Add dependency on ZODB3 as we use Persistent.

- Use a mock request for testing. Dropped the dependency on zope.publisher
  which was really only a testing dependency.

- Reduced the dependency on zope.container to one on zope.location by no
  longer using the Contained mix-in class.

3.6.0 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container

- Move error log bootstrapping logic (which was untested) to
  ``zope.app.appsetup``, to which we added a test.

zope.event
~~~~~~~~~~

3.4.1 (2009-03-03)
******************

- A few minor cleanups.

zope.exceptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.6.1 (2010-07-06)
******************

- Fixed tests to work under Python 2.7.

- PEP8 cleanup and removed obsolete build infrastructure files.

3.6.0 (2010-05-02)
******************

- Added support to bootstrap on Jython.

- Added Python 3 support.

- The dependency on zope.testing seemed spurious, possibly a rest of a real
  dependency that is gone now. I removed it.

3.5.2 (2008-04-30)
******************

- Updated CHANGES.txt.


3.5.1 (2008-04-28)
******************

- Reverted changes in 3.5.0.

3.5.0
*****

- Added the capability for exceptions to be formatted line-by-line.
  Unfortunately, also introduced a bug cause each line of the exception to be
  its own log message.

zope.file
~~~~~~~~~

0.5.0 (2009-07-23)
******************

- Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org instead
  of the retired one.

- Made tests compatible with ZODB 3.9.

- Removed not needed install requirement declarations.


0.4.0 (2009-01-31)
******************

- `openDetached` is now protected by zope.View instead of zope.ManageContent.

- Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container.

zope.filerepresentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.6.0 (2009-10-08)
******************

- Added IRawReadFile and IRawWriteFile interfaces. These extend IReadFile and
  IWritefile, respectively, to behave pretty much like a standard Python file
  object with a few embellishments. This in turn allows efficient, iterator-
  based implementations of file reading and writing.

- Removed DEPENDENCIES.cfg

- Removed dependency on zope.container: IReadDirectory and IWriteDirectory
  inherit only from interfaces defined in zope.interface and
  zope.interface.common.mapping.

3.5.0 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Changed use of zope.app.container to zope.container.

zope.formlib
~~~~~~~~~~~~

4.0.4 (2010-07-06)
******************

- Fixed tests to pass under Python 2.7.

- Fix validation of "multiple" attributes in orderedSelectionList.pt.

4.0.2 (2010-03-07)
******************

- Adapted tests for Python 2.4 (enforce sorting for short pprint output)

4.0.1 (2010-02-21)
******************

- Documentation uploaded to PyPI now contains widget documentation.
- Escape MultiCheckBoxWidget content [LP:302427].

4.0 (2010-01-08)
****************

- Widget implementation and all widgets from zope.app.form have been
  moved into zope.formlib, breaking zope.formlib's dependency on
  zope.app.form (instead zope.app.form now depends on zope.formlib).

  Widgets can all be imported from ``zope.formlib.widgets``.

  Widget base classes and render functionality is in
  ``zope.formlib.widget``.

  All relevant widget interfaces are now in ``zope.formlib.interfaces``.

3.10.0 (2009-12-22)
*******************

- Use named template from zope.browserpage in favor of zope.app.pagetemplate.

3.9.0 (2009-12-22)
******************

- Use ViewPageTemplateFile from zope.browserpage.

3.8.0 (2009-12-22)
******************

- Adjusted test output to new zope.schema release.

3.7.0 (2009-12-18)
******************

- Rid ourselves from zope.app test dependencies.

- Fix: Button label needs escaping

3.6.0 (2009-05-18)
******************

- Remove deprecated imports.

- Remove dependency on zope.app.container (use ``IAdding`` from
  ``zope.browser.interfaces``) instead.  Depend on
  ``zope.browser>=1.1`` (the version with ``IAdding``).

- Moved ``namedtemplate`` to ``zope.app.pagetemplate``, to cut some
  dependencies on ``zope.formlib`` when using this feature. Left BBB
  imports here.

3.5.2 (2009-02-21)
******************

- Adapt tests for Python 2.5 output.

3.5.1 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Adapt tests to upcoming zope.schema release 3.5.1.

3.5.0 (2009-01-26)
******************

New Features
++++++++++++

- Test dependencies are declared in a `test` extra now.

- Introduced ``zope.formlib.form.applyData`` which works like
  ``applyChanges`` but returns a dictionary with information about
  which attribute of which schema changed.  This information is then
  sent along with the ``IObjectModifiedEvent``.

  This fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/98483.

Bugs Fixed
++++++++++

- Actions that cause a redirect (301, 302) do not cause the `render` method to
  be called anymore.

- The zope.formlib.form.Action class didn't fully implement
  zope.formlib.interfaces.IAction.

- zope.formlib.form.setupWidgets and zope.formlib.form.setupEditWidgets did
  not check for write access on the adapter but on context. This fixes
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/219948

zope.hookable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.4.1 (2009-04-05)
******************

- Updated tests for compatibility with Python 2.6 traceback formats.

- Use Jython-compatible ``bootstrap.py``.

zope.html
~~~~~~~~~

2.1.0 (2010-05-25)
******************

- Use CKEditor 3.2.1

- Added configuration to use un-minified version of CKEditor when using dev
  mode.

- Fixed import that caused test failures.

2.0.0 (2009-09-04)
******************

- Add CKeditor 3.0 widget.

1.2.0 (2009-07-06)
******************

- Use FCKeditor 2.6.4.1

- Remove _samples directory and erect a barrier to its resurrection

1.1.0 (2008-06-18)
******************

- Use FCKeditor 2.6

- Use versioned directories for javascript to cache-bust

zope.i18n
~~~~~~~~~

3.7.2 (2009-12-14)
******************

- It's a critical error when the ``GetText`` library is unavailable
  and compilation is required.

- Use getSiteManager rather than getGlobalSiteManager in ZCML (these
  should be one in the same in any non-fancy setup, however if you've
  hooked getSiteManager, you want the ZCML handler to use the hooked
  version).

3.7.1 (2009-08-07)
******************

- Fixed the interpackage translation domain merging feature to actually work.
  We need to defer the merging into the ZCML handler execution phase, as the
  utilities don't exist yet during the ZCML parsing phase. Thx to Andreas
  Zeidler for finding and fixing the issue in PlacelessTranslationService in
  the first place.

- Fix translation domains translating a message for a different domain. In the
  process, fix testMessageIDTranslateForDifferentDomain which seemed to work by
  mistake as the "other" and "default" domains used the same catalog. This is
  basically a reversion of 39991.


3.7.0 (2009-03-18)
******************

- Updated locale data to CLDR 1.1. This introduces contextual month
  and day names and different month/day name widths. More CLDR updates
  are expected, see the "nadako-cldr" branch of zope.i18n.

- Add `configure.zcml` that registers standard negotiator utility and includes
  ``zope.i18n.locales`` configuration. This was previously done by
  ``zope.app.i18n``.


3.6.0 (2008-10-26)
******************

- Fixed a test failure in the compile mo file support.

- Move the zcml support into an extra. This reduces the dependencies of a
  standard zope.i18n install by half a dozen packages.


3.5.0 (2008-07-10)
******************

- Feature: Added new top-level negotiate function, which can be used to
  negotiate the language when the available languages are set globally via
  `zope_i18n_allowed_languages`.

- Feature: Added support for restricting the available languages. We support
  an environment variable called `zope_i18n_allowed_languages` now, which is
  a list of comma or space separated language codes. If the environment
  variable is set, the ZCML registration will only process those folders
  which are in the allowed languages list.

- Feature: Added optional automatic compilation of mo files from po files.
  You need to depend on the `zope.i18n [compile]` extra and set an environment
  variable called `zope_i18n_compile_mo_files` to any True value to enable
  this option.

- Feature: Re-use existing translation domains when registering new ones.
  This allows multiple packages to register translations in the same domain.
  If the same message exists in multiple catalogs the one registered first
  will take precedence.

- Feature: Recursive translations of message strings with mappings
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/210177), thanks to Hermann
  Himmelbauer for the inital patch.

- Bug: When parsing a date, the parsing pattern did not ensure that the line
  started and ended with the matching pattern, so that '1/1/2007' parsed into
  '1/1/20' for example.

zope.i18nmessageid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.5.3 (2010-08-10)
******************

- Made compilation of C extension optional again; 3.5.1 broke this
  inasmuch as this package become unusable on non-CPython platforms.
  Making the compilation of the C extension optional again implied
  removing ``setup.py`` code added in 3.5.1 which made the C extension
  a setuptools "Feature" and readding code from 3.5.0 which overrides
  the distutils ``build_ext`` command.

- Move pickle equality tests into a unittest.TestCase test to make it
  easier to condition the tests on whether the C extension has been
  compiled.  This also makes the tests pass on Jython.

3.5.2 (2010-04-30)
******************

- Removed use of 'zope.testing.doctestunit' in favor of stdlib's 'doctest.

3.5.1 (2010-04-10)
******************

- LP #257657 / 489529:  Fix memory leak in C extension.

- Fixed the compilation of the C extension with python 2.6: refactored it as a
  setuptools Feature.

3.5.0 (2009-06-27)
******************

- Made compilation of C extension optional.

- Added support to bootstrap on Jython.

- Changed package's mailing list address from zope3-dev at zope.org to
  zope-dev at zope.org, because zope3-dev is now retired.

- Reformatted change log to common formatting style.

- Update package description and docs a little.

- Remove old .cfg files for zpkg.

zope.index
~~~~~~~~~~

3.6.1 (2010-07-08)
******************

- TextIndex:  reuse the lexicon from the underlying Okapi / Cosine
  index, if passed.  (LP #232516)

- Lexicon:  avoid raising an exception when indexing None. (LP #598776)

3.6.0 (2009-08-03)
******************

- Improved test readability and reached 100% test coverage.

- Fixed a broken optimization in okascore.c: it was passing a Python
  float to the PyInt_AS_LONG() macro. This resulted in wrong scores,
  especially on 64 bit platforms, where all scores typically ended up
  being zero.

- Changed okascore.c to produce the same results as its Python
  equivalent, reducing the brittleness of the text index tests.

3.5.2 (2009-06-09)
******************

- Port okascore.c optimization used in okapiiindex from Zope2 catalog
  implementation.  This module is compiled conditionally, based on
  whether your environment has a working C compiler.

- Don't use ``len(self._docweight)`` in okapiindex _search_wids method
  (obtaining the length of a BTree is very expensive at scale).
  Instead use self.documentCount().  Also a Zope2 port.

3.5.1 (2009-02-27)
******************

- The baseindex, okapiindex, and lexicon used plain counters for various
  lengths, which is unsuitable for production applications.
  Backport code from Zope2 indexes which opportunistically replaces the
  counters with BTree.Length objects.

- Backport non-insane version of baseindex._del_wordinfo from
  Zope2 text index.  This improves deletion performance by
  several orders of magnitude.

- Don't modify given query dictionary in the KeywordIndex.apply method.

- Move FieldIndex's sorting functionality to a mixin class so it can
  be reused by zc.catalog's ValueIndex.

3.5.0 (2008-12-30)
******************

- Remove zope.testing from dependencies, as it's not really needed.

- Define IIndexSort interface for indexes that support sorting.

- Implement sorting for FieldIndex (adapted from repoze.catalog/ZCatalog).

- Add an ``apply`` method for KeywordIndex/TopicIndex, making them
  implement IIndexSearch that can be useful in catalog.

- Optimize the ``search`` method of KeywordIndex/TopicIndex by using
  multiunion for the ``or`` operator and sorting before intersection for ``and``.

- IMPORTANT: KeywordIndex/TopicIndex now use IFSets instead of IISets.
  This makes it more compatible with other indexes (for example, when
  using in catalog). This change can lead to problems, if your code somehow
  depends on the II nature of sets, as it was before.
  
  Also, FilteredSets used to use IFSets as well, if you have any
  FilteredSets pickled in the database, you need to migrate them to
  IFSets yourself. You can do it like that:
  
      filter._ids = filter.family.IF.Set(filter._ids)
  
  Where ``filter`` is an instance of FilteredSet.

- IMPORTANT: KeywordIndex are now non-normalizing. Because
  it can be useful for non-string keywords, where case-normalizing
  doesn't make any sense. Instead, it provides the ``normalize``
  method that can be overriden by subclasses to provide some
  normalization.
  
  The CaseInsensitiveKeywordIndex class is now provided that
  do case-normalization for string-based keywords. The old
  CaseSensitiveKeywordIndex is gone, applications should use
  KeywordIndex for that.

Looks like the KeywordIndex/TopicIndex was sort of abadonware
and wasn't used by application developers, so after some
discussion we decided to refactor them to make them more
usable, optimal and compatible with other indexes and catalog.

Porting application from old KeywordIndex/TopicIndex to new
ones are rather easy and explained above, so we believe that
it isn't a problem. Please, use zope3-users@zope.org or
zope-dev@zope.org mailing lists, if you have any problems
with migration.

Thanks Chris McDonough of repoze for supporting and useful code.

zope.interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.6.1 (2010-05-03)
******************

- A non-ascii character in the changelog made 3.6.0 uninstallable on Python 3 systems 
  with another default encoding than UTF-8.

- Fixed compiler warnings under GCC 4.3.3.

3.6.0 (2010-04-29)
******************

- LP #185974:  Clear the cache used by ``Specificaton.get`` inside
  ``Specification.changed``.  Thanks to Jacob Holm for the patch.

- Added support for Python 3.1. Contributors:

    Lennart Regebro
    Martin v Loewis
    Thomas Lotze
    Wolfgang Schnerring

  The 3.1 support is completely backwards compatible. However, the implements
  syntax used under Python 2.X does not work under 3.X, since it depends on
  how metaclasses are implemented and this has changed. Instead it now supports
  a decorator syntax (also under Python 2.X)::

    class Foo:
        implements(IFoo)
        ...

  can now also be written::

    @implementor(IFoo):
    class Foo:
        ...

  There are 2to3 fixers available to do this change automatically in the
  zope.fixers package.

- Python 2.3 is no longer supported.

3.5.4 (2009-12-23)
******************

- Use the standard Python doctest module instead of zope.testing.doctest, which
  has been deprecated.


3.5.3 (2009-12-08)
******************

- Fix an edge case: make providedBy() work when a class has '__provides__' in
  its __slots__ (see http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.zope.devel/22490)


3.5.2 (2009-07-01)
******************

- BaseAdapterRegistry.unregister, unsubscribe: Remove empty portions of
  the data structures when something is removed.  This avoids leaving
  references to global objects (interfaces) that may be slated for
  removal from the calling application.


3.5.1 (2009-03-18)
******************

- verifyObject: use getattr instead of hasattr to test for object attributes
  in order to let exceptions other than AttributeError raised by properties
  propagate to the caller

- Add Sphinx-based documentation building to the package buildout
  configuration. Use the ``bin/docs`` command after buildout.

- Improve package description a bit. Unify changelog entries formatting.

- Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org as
  zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired.


3.5.0 (2008-10-26)
******************

- Fixed declaration of _zope_interface_coptimizations, it's not a top level
  package.

- Add a DocTestSuite for odd.py module, so their tests are run.

- Allow to bootstrap on Jython.

- Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/3.3/+bug/98388: ISpecification
  was missing a declaration for __iro__.

- Added optional code optimizations support, which allows the building
  of C code optimizations to fail (Jython).

- Replaced `_flatten` with a non-recursive implementation, effectively making
  it 3x faster.

zope.intid
~~~~~~~~~~

3.7.2 (2009-12-27)
******************

- Use the zope.component API in favor of ztapi.

- Removed ``zope.app.testing`` dependency.

3.7.1 (2009-05-18)
******************

- Remove dependencies on ``zope.container``.  Instead import
  ``Object*Event`` classes from ``zope.lifecycleevent`` and import
  ``IContained`` from ``zope.location``.  In order to be able to do
  this, depend on ``zope.lifecycleevent``>=3.5.2 and
  ``zope.location``>=3.5.4.

- Remove a dependency on ``zope.container.contained.Contained``
  (this is a dumb base class that defines __parent__ and __name__
  as None and declares that the class implements IContained).

3.7.0 (2009-02-01)
******************

- Split out this package from ``zope.app.intid``. The latter one
  now only contains browser views and compatibility imports while
  whole IntId functionality is moved here. 

zope.keyreference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.6.2 (2009-09-15)
******************

- Made the tests pass with ZODB3.9, which changed the repr() of the persistent
  classes.

3.6.1 (2009-02-01)
******************

- Load keyreferences, pickled by old zope.app.keyreference even
  if its not installed anymore (so don't break if one updates a
  project that don't directly depends on zope.app.keyreference). 

3.6.0 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Rename ``zope.app.keyreference`` to ``zope.keyreference``.

zope.kgs
~~~~~~~~

1.2.0 (2009-07-24)
******************

- Add ability to specify the extra-includes for running tests.

1.1.0 (2009-02-01)
******************

- Added '--no-links', '--no-index', and '--no-minimal-index' options to the
  site generation sctipt to make it faster.

- Generating list of latest versions does not fail anymore, if downloading and
  parsing of the index page fails.

- Update links to PyPI web sites.

1.0.1 (2009-01-29)
******************

- Fix documentation in all scripts, fixing missing imports and incorrect
  wording.

- The package should depend on `python-dateutl` and not `datetutil`, since the
  latter is not available in PyPI anymore.

1.0.0 (2009-01-29)
******************

- Initial version as ``zope.kgs``.

  * A script that extracts the relevant part of the changelog of each package
    in the KGS.

  * A script that lists all versions of a package released after the latest
    version listed in the KGS.

  * A script that manages the generation of the entire KGS site.

    + Generates generic and version-specific pages.

    + Page generation is template-based for easy customization.

  * Generate `links.html` file which lists all controlled packages files.

  * Features copied from ``zope.release``:

    + Parser for KGS configuration files.

    + Generate `versions.cfg` and `buildout.cfg` script.

  * Features copied from ``zc.mirrorcheeseshopslashsimple``:

    + Generate new index pages for the controlled packages.

zope.lifecycleevent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.6.1 (2010-04-30)
******************

- Removed dependency on undeclared zope.testing.doctest.

3.6.0 (2009-12-29)
******************

- Refactor tests to loose zope.annotation and zope.dublincore as dependencies.

3.5.2 (2009-05-17)
******************

- ``IObjectMovedEvent``, ``IObjectAddedEvent``,
  ``IObjectRemovedEvent`` interfaces and ``ObjectMovedEvent``,
  ``ObjectAddedEvent`` and ``ObjectRemovedEvent`` classes copied here
  from zope.container (plus tests).  The intent is to allow packages
  that rely on these interfaces or the event classes to rely on
  zope.lifecycleevent (which has few dependencies) instead of
  zope.container (which has many).

3.5.1 (2009-03-09)
******************

- Remove deprecated code and thus remove dependency on zope.deferredimport.

- Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org, as
  zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired. 

- Update package's description and documentation.

3.5.0 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Remove old module declarations from classes.

- Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container.

zope.location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.9.0 (2009-12-29)
******************

- Moved LocationCopyHook related tests to zope.copy and remove a test
  dependency on that package.

3.8.2 (2009-12-23)
******************

- Fixed a typo in the configure.zcml.

3.8.1 (2009-12-23)
******************

- Removed dependency on zope.copy: the LocationCopyHook adapter is registered
  only if zope.copy is available.

- Use the standard Python doctest module instead of zope.testing.doctest, which
  has been deprecated.

3.8.0 (2009-12-22)
******************

- Adjusted to testing output caused by new zope.schema.

3.7.1 (2009-11-18)
******************

- Moved the IPossibleSite and ISite interfaces to zope.component as they are
  dealing with zope.component's concept of a site, but not with location.

3.7.0 (2009-09-29)
******************

- Added getParent() to ILocationInfo and moved the actual implementation here
  from zope.traversal.api, analogous to getParents().

- Actually removed deprecated PathPersistent class from
  zope.location.pickling.

- Moved ITraverser back to zope.traversing where it belongs conceptually. The
  interface had been moved to zope.location to invert the package
  interdependency but is no longer used here.

3.6.0 (2009-08-27)
******************

- New feature release: deprecated locationCopy, CopyPersistent and
  PathPersistent from zope.location.pickling. These changes were already part
  of the 3.5.3 release, which was erroneously numbered as a bugfix relese.

- Removed dependency on zope.deferredimport, directly import deprecated modules
  without using it.

3.5.5 (2009-08-15)
******************

- Add zope.deferredimport as a dependency as it's used directly by
  zope.location.pickling.

3.5.4 (2009-05-17)
******************

- Add ``IContained`` interface to ``zope.location.interfaces`` module.
  This interface was moved from ``zope.container`` (after
  ``zope.container`` 3.8.2); consumers of ``IContained`` may now
  depend on zope.location rather than zope.container to reduce
  dependency cycles.

3.5.3 (2009-02-09)
******************

- Use new zope.copy package for implementing location copying. Thus
  there's changes in the ``zope.locaton.pickling`` module:
  
   * The ``locationCopy`` and ``CopyPersistent`` was removed in prefer
     to their equivalents in zope.copy. Deprecated backward-compatibility
     imports provided.
   
   * The module now provides a ``zope.copy.interfaces.ICopyHook`` adapter
     for ``ILocation`` objects that replaces the old CopyPersistent
     functionality of checking for the need to clone objects based on
     their location.

3.5.2 (2009-02-04)
******************

- Split RootPhysicallyLocatable adapter back from LocationPhysicallyLocatable,
  because the IRoot object may not always provide ILocation and the code
  for the root object is also simplier. It's basically a copy of the
  RootPhysicallyLocatable adapter from zope.traversing version 3.5.0 and
  below with ``getParents`` method added (returns an empty list).

3.5.1 (2009-02-02)
******************

- Improve test coverage.

- The new ``getParents`` method was extracted from ``zope.traversing``
  and added to ILocationInfo interface in the previous release. Custom
  ILocationInfo implementations should make sure they have this method
  as well. That method is already used in ``zope.traversing.api.getParents``
  function.

- Make ``getName`` of LocationPhysicallyLocatable always return empty
  string for the IRoot object, like RootPhysicallyLocatable from
  ``zope.traversing`` did. So, now LocationPhysicallyLocatable is
  fully compatible with RootPhysicallyLocatable, making the latter one
  obsolete.

- Change package mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org instead
  of retired zope3-dev at zope.org.

3.5.0 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Reverse the dependency between zope.location and zope.traversing. This
  also causes the dependency to various other packages go away.

zope.login
~~~~~~~~~~

1.0.0 (2009-12-31)
******************

- Extracted BasicAuthAdapter and FTPAuth adapters from zope.publisher. They
  should have never gone into that package in the first place.

zope.mimetype
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.3.0 (2010-06-26)
******************

- Added testing dependency on ``zope.component [test]``.

- Use zope.formlib instead of zope.app.form.browser for select widget.

- Conform to repository policy.

1.2.0 (2009-12-26)
******************

- Converted functional tests to unit tests and get rid of all extra test
  dependencies as a result.

- Use the ITerms interface from zope.browser.

- Declared missing dependencies, resolved direct dependency on
  zope.app.publisher.

- Import content-type parser from zope.contenttype, adding a dependency on
  that package.

1.1.2 (2009-05-22)
******************

- No longer depends on ``zope.app.component``.

1.1.1 (2009-04-03)
******************

- Fixed wrong package version (version ``1.1.0`` was released as ``0.4.0`` at
  `pypi` but as ``1.1dev`` at `download.zope.org/distribution`)

- Fixed author email and home page address.

1.1.0 (2007-11-01)
******************

- Package data update.

- First public release.

1.0.0 (2007-??-??)
******************

- Initial release.

zope.minmax
~~~~~~~~~~~

1.1.2 (2009-09-24)
******************

- Use the standard Python doctest module instead of the deprecated
  zope.testing.doctest.

1.1.1 (2009-09-09)
******************

- Fixed homepage link and mailing list address.
- Cleaned up.

1.1 (2007-10-02)
****************

- Refactored package setup.

1.0 (2007-09-28)
****************

- No further changes since 1.0b2

1.0b2 (2007-07-09)
******************

- Removed ``_p_independent`` method from ``AbstractValue`` class.


1.0b1 (2007-07-03)
******************

- Initial release.

zope.modulealias
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(no changes)

zope.pagetemplate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.5.2 (2010-07-08)
******************

- Fixed PTRuntimeError exception messages to be consistent across Python
  versions, and compatibile with the output under Python 2.4.  (More
  readable than the previous output under Python 2.6 as well.)

3.5.1 (2010-04-30)
******************

- Removed use of 'zope.testing.doctestunit' in favor of stdlib's doctest.

- Added dependency on "zope.security [untrustedpython]" because the 'engine'
  module uses it.

3.5.0 (2009-05-25)
******************

- Added test coverage reporting support.

- Moved 'engine' module and related test scaffolding here from
  ``zope.app.pagetemplate`` package.

3.4.2 (2009-03-17)
******************

- Remove old zpkg-related DEPENDENCIES.cfg file.

- Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org, as
  zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired.

- Change `cheeseshop` to `pypi` in the packages' homepage url.

3.4.1 (2009-01-27)
******************

- Fix test due to recent changes in zope.tal.


zope.password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.6.1 (2010-05-27)
******************

- The SSHAPasswordManager.checkPassword() would not handle unicode input
  (even if the string would only contain ascii characters). Now, the
  encoded_password input will be encoded to ascii, which is deemed safe as it
  should not contain non-ascii characters anyway.

3.6.0 (2010-05-07)
******************

- Removed zope.testing dependency for tests.

- Updated some copyright headers to comply to repository policy.

- Added zpasswd script formerly hold in zope.app.server. Contrary to
  former zpasswd script, which used "Plain Text" as default password
  manager, now SSHA is used as default.

3.5.1 (2009-03-14)
******************

- Make security protection directives in `configure.zcml` execute only
  if ``zope.security`` is installed. This will allow reuse of the
  `configure.zcml` file in environments without ``zope.security``,
  for example with ``repoze.zcml``.

- Add "Password Manager Names" vocabulary for use with ``zope.schema``
  and ``zope.component``, like it was in ``zope.app.authentication``.
  It's an optional feature so it doesn't add hard dependency. We use
  "vocabulary" extra to list dependencies needed for vocabulary functionality.

3.5.0 (2009-03-06)
******************

First release. This package was splitted off from ``zope.app.authentication``
to separate password manager functionality that is greatly re-usable without
any bit of ``zope.app.authentication`` and to reduce its dependencies.

zope.pluggableauth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.0.3 (2010-07-09)
******************

* Fixed dependency declaration.

1.0.2 (2010-07-90)
******************

* Added persistent.Persistent and zope.container.contained.Contained as
  bases zope.pluggableauth.plugins.session.SessionCredentialsPlugin, so
  instances of zope.app.authentication.session.SessionCredentialsPlugin
  won't be changed.
  (https://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope-dev/2010-July/040898.html)

1.0.1 (2010-02-11)
******************

* Adapters are now declared in a new ZCML file :
  `principalfactories.zcml`. This avoids duplication errors in
  ``zope.app.authentication``.

1.0 (2010-02-05)
****************

* Splitting off from zope.app.authentication

zope.principalannotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.6.1 (2010-05-05)
******************

- Fixed a test failure in nested local site manager setup.

- Removed dependency on zope.container.

3.6.0 (2009-03-09)
******************

Initial release. This package was splitted off zope.app.principalannotation
to remove its dependencies on "zope 3 application server" components.

In addition, the following changes were made after split off:

 - The IAnnotations implementation was fixed to look in the higher-level
   utility not only on ``__getitem__``, but also on ``get`` and ``__nonzero``.

 - Tests was reworked into the README.txt doctest.

 - Added a buildout part that generates Sphinx documentation from the
   README.txt

zope.principalregistry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.7.0 (2009-03-14)
******************

- Remove ``zope.container`` dependency, as contained principals didn't make any
  sense, since PrincipalRegistry never provided IContainer. Also, zope.container
  pulls a number dependencies, that are not needed for non-persistent principal
  registry (like, ZODB, for example).
  
  Set __name__ and __parent__ by hand to provide some backward-compatibility and
  to save a pointer to registry from principal objects.

- Initial release. This package was splitted from zope.app.security as a part
  of the refactoring process to provide global principal registry without extra
  dependencies.

zope.processlifetime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

zope.proxy
~~~~~~~~~~

3.6.1 (2010-07-06)
******************

- Make tests compatible with Python 2.7.

3.6.0 (2010-04-30)
******************

- Removed test extra and the remaining dependency on zope.testing.

- Removed use of 'zope.testing.doctestunit' in favor of stdlib's 'doctest.

3.5.0 (2009/01/31)
******************

- Added support to bootstrap on Jython.

- Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container.

zope.ptresource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.9.0 (2009-08-27)
******************

Initial release. This package was splitted off zope.app.publisher as a part
of refactoring process. It's now a plugin for another package that was
refactored from zope.app.publisher - zope.browserresource. See its
documentation for more details.

Other changes:

 * Don't render PageTemplateResource when called as the IResource interface
   requires that __call__ method should return an absolute URL. When accessed
   by browser, it still will be rendered, because "browserDefault" method now
   returns a callable that will render the template to browser.

zope.publisher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.12.4 (2010-07-15)
*******************

- LP #131460: Make principal logging unicode safe.
- Remove use of string exceptions in tests, http://bugs.debian.org/585343
- Add IStartRequestEvent and StartRequestEvent for using in
  zope.app.publication (matching up with IEndRequestEvent and EndRequestEvent).
  This included refactoring to produce one definition of 'event with a request'
  - IRequestEvent.

3.12.3 (2010-04-30)
*******************

- LP #209440: Don't obscure original exception when handling retries
  in ``publish.publish()`` with ``handleErrors == False``.   This change
  makes debugging such exception in unit tests easier.
  Thanks to James Henstridge for the patch.

- LP #98395: allow unicode output of XML content whose mimetype does not
  begin with ``text/``, per RFC 3023 as well as for content types ending
  in ``+xml`` such as Mozilla XUL's ``application/vnd+xml``.  Thanks to
  Justin Ryan for the patch.

3.12.2 (2010-04-16)
*******************

- Removed use of 'zope.testing.doctestunit' in favor of stdlib's 'doctest'.

- Fixed bug where xml-rpc requests would hang when served using
  paster.httpserver.

3.12.1 (2010-02-21)
*******************

- BaseRequest.traverse should not call traversal hooks on elements
  previously traversed but wrapped in a security Proxy.

3.12.0 (2009-12-31)
*******************

- Reverted change done in 3.6.2. The zope.authentication dependency has been
  removed again. The BasicAuthAdapter and FTPAuth adapters are now found in
  the new zope.login package.

3.11.0 (2009-12-15)
*******************

- Moved EndRequestEvent and IEndRequestEvent from zope.app.publication into
  this package.

3.10.1 (2009-11-28)
*******************

- Version 3.10.0 needs at least version 3.5 of zope.contenttype but it
  did not declare it.

3.10.0 (2009-10-22)
*******************

- Moved the implementation of zope.publisher.contenttype to
  zope.contenttype.parse, leaving BBB imports and moving tests along.
  zope.contenttype is a new but light-weight dependency of this package.

- Supported Python 2.6 by keeping QUERY_STRING out of request.form if
  the method is a POST.  The original QUERY_STRING is still available if
  further processing is needed.

- Better supported the zcml ``defaultSkin`` directive's behavior (registering
  an interface as a default skin) in the ``setDefaultSkin`` function.

3.9.3 (2009-10-08)
******************

- Fixed the check for untrusted redirects introduced in 3.9.0 so it works with
  virtual hosting.

3.9.2 (2009-10-07)
******************

- Make redirect validation works without HTTP_HOST variable.

- Add DoNotReRaiseException adapter that can be registered
  for exceptions to flag that they should not be re-raised by
  publisher when ``handle_errors`` parameter of the ``publish``
  method is False.

3.9.1 (2009-09-01)
******************

- Convert a location, passed to a redirect method of HTTPRequest to
  string before checking for trusted host redirection, because a
  location object may be some non-string convertable to string, like
  URLGetter.

3.9.0 (2009-08-27)
******************

- Some parts of zope.app.publisher packages was moved into this package
  during zope.app.publisher refactoring:

   * IModifiableUserPreferredLanguages adapter for requests
   * browser:defaultView and browser:defaultSkin ZCML directives
   * IHTTPView, IXMLRPCView and like interfaces
   * security ZCML declarations for some of zope.publisher classes

- Introduced ``IReRaiseException`` interface. If during publishing an
  exception occurs and for this exception an adapter is available that
  returns ``False`` on being called, the exception won't be reraised
  by the publisher. This happens only if ``handle_errors`` parameter
  of the ``publish()`` method is set to ``False``. Fixes problems when
  acting in a WSGI pipeline with a debugger middleware enabled.

  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/332061 for details.

- Fix #98471: Restrict redirects to current host. This causes a ValueError to
  be raised in the case of redirecting to a different host. If this is
  intentional, the parameter `trusted` can be given.

- Moved dependency on zope.testing from install_requires to tests_require.

- Removed behavior of doing a time.sleep in the supportsRetry http request.

- Add a fix for Internet Explorer versions that upload files will full
  filesystem paths as filenames.

3.8.0 (2009-05-23)
******************

- Moved IHTTPException, IMethodNotAllowed, and MethodNotAllowed from
  zope.app.http to zope.publisher.interfaces.http, fixing dependency
  cycles involving zope.app.http.

- Moved the DefaultViewName API from zope.app.publisher.browser to
  zope.publisher.defaultview, making it accessible to other packages
  that need it.

3.7.0 (2009-05-13)
******************

- Move ``IView`` and ``IBrowserView`` interfaces into
  ``zope.browser.interfaces``, leaving BBB imports.

3.6.4 (2009-04-26)
******************

- Added some BBB code to setDefaultSkin to allow IBrowserRequest's to continue
  to work without configuring any special adapter for IDefaultSkin.

- Move `getDefaultSkin` to the skinnable module next to the `setDefaultSkin`
  method, leaving a BBB import in place. Mark `IDefaultBrowserLayer` as a
  `IBrowserSkinType` in code instead of relying on the ZCML to be loaded.

3.6.3 (2009-03-18)
******************

- Mark HTTPRequest as IAttributeAnnotatable if ``zope.annotation`` is
  available, this was previously done by ``zope.app.i18n``.

- Register `IHTTPRequest` -> `IUserPreferredCharsets` adapter in ZCML
  configuration. This was also previously done by ``zope.app.i18n``.

3.6.2 (2009-03-14)
******************

- Add an adapter from ``zope.security.interfaces.IPrincipal`` to
  ``zope.publisher.interfaces.logginginfo.ILoggingInfo``. It was moved
  from ``zope.app.security`` as a part of refactoring process.

- Add adapters from HTTP and FTP request to
  ``zope.authentication.ILoginPassword`` interface. They are moved from
  ``zope.app.security`` as a part of refactoring process. This change adds a
  dependency on the ``zope.authentication`` package, but it's okay, since it's
  a tiny contract definition-only package.

  See http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope-dev/2009-March/035325.html for
  reasoning.

3.6.1 (2009-03-09)
******************

- Fix: remove IBrowserRequest dependency in http implementation based on
  condition for setDefaultSkin. Use ISkinnable instead of IBrowserRequest.

3.6.0 (2009-03-08)
******************

- Clean-up: Move skin related code from zope.publisher.interfaces.browser and
  zope.publisher.browser to zope.publihser.interfaces and
  zope.publisher.skinnable and provide BBB imports. See skinnable.txt for more
  information.

- Fix: ensure that we only apply skin interface in setDefaultSkin which also
  provide IBrowserSkinType. This will ensure that we find a skin if the
  applySkin method will lookup for a skin based on this type interface.

- Fix: Make it possible to use adapters and not only interfaces as skins from
  the adapter registry. Right now the defaultSkin directive registers simple
  interfaces as skin adapters which will run into a TypeError if someone tries
  to adapter such a skin adapter. Probably we should change the defaultSkin
  directive and register real adapters instead of using the interfaces as fake
  adapters where we expect adapter factories.

- Feature: allow to use applySkin with different skin types using the optional
  argument skinType which is by default set to IBrowserSkinType

- Feature: implemented the default skin pattern within adapters. This allows
  us to register default skins for other requests then only IBrowserRequest
  using IDefaultSkin adapters.

  Note, ISkinnable and ISkinType and the skin implementation should be moved
  out of the browser request modules. Packages like z3c.jsonrpc do not depend
  on IBrowserRequest but they are skinnable.

- Feature: added ISkinnable interface which allows us to implement the apply
  skin pattern not only for IBrowserRequest

- Fix: Don't cause warnings on Python 2.6

- Fix: Make IBrowserPage inherit IBrowserView.

- Move IView and IDefaultViewName from zope.component.interfaces to
  zope.publisher.interfaces. Stop inheriting from deprecated (for years)
  interfaces defined in zope.component.

- Remove deprecated code.

- Clean-up: Move "zope.testing" from extras to dependencies, per Zope
  Framework policy.  Remove zope.app.testing as a dependency: tests run fine
  without it.

3.5.6 (2009-02-14)
******************

Bugs fixed:

* An untested code path that incorrectly attempted to construct a NotFound was
  fixed, with a test.


3.5.5 (2009-02-04)
******************

* LP #322486: setStatus() now allows any int()-able status value.


3.5.4 (2008-09-22)
******************

Bugs fixed:

* LP #98440: interfaces lost on retried request

* LP #273296: dealing more nicely with malformed HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE headers
  within getPreferredLanguages().

* LP #253362: dealing more nicely with malformed HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET headers
  within getPreferredCharsets().

* LP #98284: Pass the ``size`` argument to readline, as the version of
  twisted used in zope.app.twisted supports it.

* Fix the LP #98284 fix: do not pass ``size`` argument of None that causes
  cStringIO objects to barf with a TypeError.


3.5.3 (2008-06-20)
******************

Bugs fixed:

* It turns out that some Web servers (Paste for example) do not send the EOF
  character after the data has been transmitted and the read() of the cached
  stream simply hangs if no expected content length has been specified.


3.5.2 (2008-04-06)
******************

Bugs fixed:

* A previous fix to handle posting of non-form data broke handling of
  form data with extra information in the content type, as in::

    application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8

3.5.1 (2008-03-23)
******************

Bugs fixed:

* When posting non-form (and non-multipart) data, the request body was
  consumed and discarded. This makes it impossible to deal with other
  post types, like xml-rpc or json without resorting to overly complex
  "request factory" contortions.

* https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/143873

  The zope.publisher.http.HTTPCharsets was confused by the Zope 2
  publisher, which gives missleading information about which headers
  it has.

3.5.0 (2008-03-02)
******************

Features added:

* Added a PasteDeploy app_factory implementation.  This should make
  it easier to integrate Zope 3 applications with PasteDeploy.  It
  also makes it easier to control the publication used, giving far
  greater control over application policies (e.g. whether or not to
  use the ZODB).

3.4.2 (2007-12-07)
******************

* Made segmentation of URLs not strip (trailing) whitespace from path segments
  to allow URLs ending in %20 to be handled correctly. (#172742)

3.4.1 (2007-09-29)
******************

No changes since 3.4.1b2.

3.4.1b2 (2007-08-02)
********************

* zope.publisher now works on Python 2.5.

* Fix a problem with request.get() when the object that's to be
  retrieved is the request itself.


3.4.1b1 (2007-07-13)
********************

No changes.


3.4.0b2 (2007-07-05)
********************

* Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/122054:
  HTTPInputStream understands both the CONTENT_LENGTH and
  HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH environment variables. It is also now tolerant
  of empty strings and will treat those as if the variable were
  absent.


3.4.0b1 (2007-07-05)
********************

* Fix caching issue. The input stream never got cached in a temp file
  because of a wrong content-length header lookup. Added CONTENT_LENGTH
  header check in addition to the previous used HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH. The
  ``HTTP_`` prefix is sometimes added by some CGI proxies, but CONTENT_LENGTH
  is the right header info for the size.

* Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/98413:
  HTTPResponse.handleException should set the content type


3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
********************

Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to zope.publisher
from Zope 3.4.0a1

zope.ramcache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.0 (2009-07-23)
****************

- Broke out the ram cache functionality from zope.app.cache.

zope.rdb
~~~~~~~~

3.5.0 (2009/01/31)
******************

- Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container.

3.4.2 (2008/10/10)
******************

- Re-release 3.4.1

3.4.1 (2008/10/10)
******************

- Remove body of DatabaseException, base Exception class already
  provides the same functionality.

- Use hashlib.md5 instead of md5.new if available. md5 module is
  deprecated and will be removed in a future Python release.

- Remove usage of 'as' as variable name. 'as' is a keyword in Python
  2.6 and generates a SyntaxError.

zope.schema
~~~~~~~~~~~

3.7.0 (2010-09-12)
******************

- Improve error messages when term tokens or values are duplicates.

- Fix the buildout so the tests run.

3.6.4 (2010-06-08)
******************

- fix validation of schema with Object Field that specify Interface schema.

3.6.3 (2010-04-30)
******************

- Prefer the standard libraries doctest module to the one from zope.testing.

3.6.2 (2010-04-30)
******************

- Avoid maximum recursion when validating Object field that points to cycles

- Made the dependency on ``zope.i18nmessageid`` optional.

3.6.1 (2010-01-05)
******************

- Allow "setup.py test" to run at least a subset of the tests runnable
  via ``bin/test`` (227 for ``setup.py test`` vs. 258. for
  ``bin/test``)

- Make ``zope.schema._bootstrapfields.ValidatedProperty`` descriptor
  work under Jython.

- Make "setup.py test" tests pass on Jython.

3.6.0 (2009-12-22)
******************

- Prefer zope.testing.doctest over doctestunit.

- Extend validation error to hold the field name.

- Add FieldProperty class that uses Field.get and Field.set methods 
  instead of storing directly on the instance __dict__.

3.5.4 (2009-03-25)
******************

- Don't fail trying to validate default value for Choice fields with
  IContextSourceBinder object given as a source. See
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/340416. 

- Add an interface for ``DottedName`` field.

- Add ``vocabularyName`` attribute to the ``IChoice`` interface, change
  "vocabulary" attribute description to be more sensible, making it
  ``zope.schema.Field`` instead of plain ``zope.interface.Attribute``.

- Make IBool interface of Bool more important than IFromUnicode so adapters
  registered for IBool take precendence over adapters registered for
  IFromUnicode.


3.5.3 (2009-03-10)
******************

- Make Choice and Bool fields implement IFromUnicode interface, because
  they do provide the ``fromUnicode`` method.

- Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org, as
  zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired.

- Fix package's documentation formatting. Change package's description.

- Add buildout part that builds Sphinx-generated documentation.

- Remove zpkg-related file.

3.5.2 (2009-02-04)
******************

- Made validation tests compatible with Python 2.5 again (hopefully not
  breaking Python 2.4)

- Added an __all__ package attribute to expose documentation.

3.5.1 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Stop using the old old set type.

- Make tests compatible and silent with Python 2.4.

- Fix __cmp__ method in ValidationError. Show some side effects based on the
  existing __cmp__ implementation. See validation.txt

- Make 'repr' of the ValidationError and its subclasses more sensible. This
  may require you to adapt your doctests for the new style, but now it makes
  much more sense for debugging for developers.

3.5.0a2 (2008-12-11)
********************

- Move zope.testing to "test" extras_require, as it is not needed
  for zope.schema itself.

- Change the order of classes in SET_TYPES tuple, introduced in
  previous release to one that was in 3.4 (SetType, set), because
  third-party code could be dependent on that order. The one
  example is z3c.form's converter.

3.5.0a1 (2008-10-10)
********************

- Added the doctests to the long description.

- Removed use of deprecated 'sets' module when running under Python 2.6.

- Removed spurious doctest failure when running under Python 2.6.

- Added support to bootstrap on Jython.

- Added helper methods for schema validation: ``getValidationErrors``
  and ``getSchemaValidationErrors``.

- zope.schema now works on Python2.5

zope.security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.7.3 (2010-04-30)
******************

- Prefer the standard libraries doctest module to the one from zope.testing.

- Fixed directlyProvides IVocabularyFactory for PermissionIdsVocabulary in
  Python code, even if it's unnecessary because IVocabularyFactory is provided
  in zcml.

- Removed the dependency on the zope.exceptions package: zope.security.checker
  now imports ``DuplicationError`` from zope.exceptions if available, otherwise
  it defines a package-specific ``DuplicationError`` class which inherits from
  Exception.

3.7.2 (2009-11-10)
******************

- Added compatibility with Python 2.6 abstract base classes.

3.7.1 (2009-08-13)
******************

- Fix for LP bug 181833 (from Gustavo Niemeyer). Before "visiting" a
  sub-object, a check should be made to ensure the object is still valid.
  Because garbage collection may involve loops, if you garbage collect an
  object, it is possible that the actions done on this object may modify the
  state of other objects. This may cause another round of garbage collection,
  eventually generating a segfault (see LP bug). The Py_VISIT macro does the
  necessary checks, so it is used instead of the previous code.

3.7.0 (2009-05-13)
******************

- Made ``pytz`` a soft dependency:  the checker for ``pytz.UTC`` is
  created / tested only if the package is already present.  Run
  ``bin/test_pytz`` to run the tests with ``pytz`` on the path.

3.6.3 (2009-03-23)
******************

- Ensure that simple zope.schema's VocabularyRegistry is used for
  PermissionVocabulary tests, because it's replaced implicitly in
  environments with zope.app.schema installed that makes that tests
  fail.

- Fixed a bug in DecoratedSecurityCheckerDescriptor which made
  security-wrapping location proxied exception instances throw
  exceptions on Python 2.5.
  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/251848

3.6.2 (2009-03-14)
******************

- Add zope.i18nmessageid.Message to non-proxied basic types. It's okay, because
  messages are immutable. It was done by zope.app.security before.

- Add "__name__" and "__parent__" attributes to list of available by default.
  This was also done by zope.app.security package before.

- Added PermissionsVocabulary and PermissionIdsVocabulary vocabularies
  to the ``zope.security.permission`` module. They were moved from
  the ``zope.app.security`` package.

- Add zcml permission definitions for most common and useful permissions,
  like "zope.View" and "zope.ManageContent", as well as for the special
  "zope.Public" permission. They are placed in a separate "permissions.zcml"
  file, so it can be easily excluded/redefined. They are selected part of
  permissions moved from ``zope.app.security`` and used by many zope.*
  packages.

- Add `addCheckerPublic` helper function in ``zope.security.testing`` module
  that registers the "zope.Public" permission as an IPermission utility.

- Add security declarations for the ``zope.security.permisson.Permission`` class.

- Improve test coverage.

3.6.1 (2009-03-10)
******************

- Use ``from`` imports instead of ``zope.deferred`` to avoid circular
  import problems, thus drop dependency on ``zope.deferredimport``.

- Raise NoInteraction when zope.security.checkPermission is called
  without interaction being active (LP #301565).

- Don't define security checkers for deprecated set types from the
  "sets" module on Python 2.6. It's discouraged to use them and
  `set` and `frozenset` built-in types should be used instead.

- Change package's mailng list address to zope-dev at zope.org as
  zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired.

- Remove old zpkg-related files.

3.6.0 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Install decorated security checker support on LocationProxy from the
  outside.

- Added support to bootstrap on Jython.

- Moved the `protectclass` module from `zope.app.security` to this
  package to reduce the number of dependencies on `zope.app.security`.

- Moved the <module> directive implementation from `zope.app.security`
  to this package.

- Moved the <class> directive implementation from `zope.app.component`
  to this package.


3.5.2 (2008-07-27)
******************

- Made C code compatible with Python 2.5 on 64bit architectures.


3.5.1 (2008-06-04)
******************

- Add `frozenset`, `set`, `reversed`, and `sorted` to the list of safe
  builtins.


3.5.0 (2008-03-05)
******************

- Changed title for ``zope.security.management.system_user`` to be more
  presentable.


3.4.0 (2007-10-02)
******************

- Updated meta-data.


3.4.0b5 (2007-08-15)
********************

- Bug: Fixed a circular import in the C implementation.

3.4.0b4 (2007-08-14)
********************

- Bug: ``zope.security.management.system_user`` had an ugly/brittle id.


3.4.0b3 (2007-08-14)
********************

- ``zope.security`` now works on Python 2.5

- Bug: ``zope.security.management.system_user`` wasn't a valid principal
  (didn't provide IPrincipal).

- Bug: Fixed inclusion of doctest to use the doctest module from
  ``zope.testing``. Now tests can be run multiple times without
  breaking. (#98250)

3.4.0b2 (2007-06-15)
********************

- Bug: Removed stack extraction in newInteraction. When using eggs this is an
  extremly expensive function. The publisher is now more than 10 times faster
  when using eggs and about twice as fast with a zope trunk checkout.

3.4.0b1
*******

- Temporarily fixed the hidden (and accidental) dependency on zope.testing to
  become optional.

Note: The releases between 3.2.0 and 3.4.0b1 where not tracked as an
individual package and have been documented in the Zope 3 changelog.


3.2.0 (2006-01-05)
******************

- Corresponds to the verison of the zope.security package shipped as part of
  the Zope 3.2.0 release.

- Removed deprecated helper functions, 'proxy.trustedRemoveSecurityProxy' and
  'proxy.getProxiedObject'.

- Made handling of 'management.{end,restore}Interaction' more careful w.r.t.
  edge cases.

- Made behavior of 'canWrite' consistent with 'canAccess':  if 'canAccess'
  does not raise 'ForbiddenAttribute', then neither will 'canWrite'.  See:
  http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope3-dev/506

- Code style / documentation / test fixes.


3.1.0 (2005-10-03)
******************

- Added support for use of the new Python 2.4 datatypes, 'set' and
  'frozenset', within checked code.

- C security proxy acquired a dependency on the 'proxy.h' header from the
  'zope.proxy' package.

- XXX: the spelling of the '#include' is bizarre!  It seems to be related to
  'zpkg'-based builds, and should likely be revisited.  For the moment, I have
  linked in the 'zope.proxy' package into our own 'include' directory.  See
  the subversion checkin: http://svn.zope.org/Zope3/?rev=37882&view=rev

- Updated checker to avoid re-proxying objects which have and explicit
  '__Security_checker__' assigned.

- Corresponds to the verison of the zope.security package shipped as part of
  the Zope 3.1.0 release.

- Clarified contract of 'IChecker' to indicate that its 'check*' methods may
  raise only 'Forbidden' or 'Unauthorized' exceptions.

- Added interfaces, ('IPrincipal', 'IGroupAwarePrincipal', 'IGroup', and
  'IPermission') specifying contracts of components in the security framework.

- Code style / documentation / test fixes.


3.0.0 (2004-11-07)
******************

- Corresponds to the version of the zope.security package shipped as part of
  the Zope X3.0.0 release.

zope.securitypolicy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.6.1 (2009-07-24)
******************

- Make tests work when the default and Zope vocabulary registry compete in the
  cleanup.

3.6.0 (2009-03-14)
******************

- Change ``zope.app.security`` dependency to the new ``zope.authentication``
  package, dropping a big number of unused dependencies.

- Get rid of ``zope.app.testing`` and other testing dependencices.

- Add ``ZODB3`` to install dependencies, because we use `Persistent`
  class. We didn't fail before, because it was installed implicitly.

3.5.1 (2009-03-10)
******************

- Don't depend on the `hook` extra of zope.component, as we don't need
  it explicitly.

- Import security settings (Allow, Deny, Unset) in the ``interfaces``
  module from the ``zope.securitypolicy.settings``, added in previous
  release instead of old ``zope.app.security.settings``.
  The ``zope.app.security`` will be adapted to import them from
  ``zope.securitypolicy.interfaces``.

- Use `_z_instances` instead of `__instances__` for storing instances
  for ``zope.securitypolicy.settings.PermissionSetting`` singleton
  implementation, because __*__ name pattern is reserved for special
  names in python.

- Add security protections for the `PermissionSetting`.

- Improve documentation formatting, add it to the package's long
  description.

- Remove unneeded dependencies.

- Remove old zpkg-related files and zcml slugs.

3.5.0 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Include settings that were previously imported from zope.app.security.

3.4.2 (2009-01-28)
******************

- Changed mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org. Fix package
  homepage to the pypi page.

- Fix test in buildout which still depended on zope.app.securitypolicy
  by mistake.

- Remove explicit dependency on zope.app.form from ``setup.py``; nothing
  in the code directly depends on this.

zope.sendmail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.7.2 (2010-04-30)
******************

- Removed no longer required testing dependency on zope.testing.

- Maildir storage for queue can now handle unicode passed in for message or
  to/from addresses (change backported from repoze.sendmail).

- Tests use stdlib doctest instead of zope.testing.doctest.

3.7.1 (2010-01-13)
******************

- Backward compatibility import of zope.sendmail.queue.QueueProcessorThread in
  zope.sendmail.delivery.

3.7.0 (2010-01-12)
******************

- Removed dependency on ``zope.security``: the security support is optional,
  and only available if the ``zope.security`` package is available. This change
  is similar to the optional security support introduced in ``zope.component``
  3.8.0, and in fact it uses the same helpers.

- Sort by modification time the messages in zope.sendmail.maildir so earlier
  messages are sent before later messages during queue processing.

- Added the new parameter ``processorThread`` to the queuedDelivery ZCML
  directive: if False, the QueueProcessorThread is not started and thus an
  independent process must process the queue; it defaults to True for b/c.

- Provide a console script ``zope-sendmail`` which can be used to process the
  delivery queue in case processorThread is False. The console script can
  either process the messages in the queue once, or run in "daemon" mode.

3.6.1 (2009-11-16)
******************

- Depend on ``zope.component`` >= 3.8.0, which supports the new semantic of
  zope.component.zcml.proxify needed by zope.sendmail.zcml.

3.6.0 (2009-09-14)
******************

- Use simple vocabulary factory function instead of custom `UtilityTerm`
  and `UtilityVocabulary` classes, copied from ``zope.app.component`` in
  the previous release.

- Depend on the ``transaction`` package instead of ``ZODB3``.

- Remove zcml slugs and zpkg-related files.

- Work around problem when used with Python >=2.5.1.  See
  https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/zope.sendmail/+bug/413335 .

3.5.1 (2009-01-26)
******************

- Copied over the UtilityTerm and UtilityVocabulary implementation from
  zope.app.component to avoid a dependency.

- Work around a problem when smtp quit fails, the mail was considered not
  delivered where just the quit failed.

3.5.0 (2008-07-05)
******************

- final release (identical with 3.5.0b2)

3.5.0b2 (2007-12-19)
********************

- If the SMTP server rejects a message (for example, when the sender or
  recipient address is malformed), that email stays in the queue forever
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/157104).


3.5.0b1 (2007-11-08)
********************

- Added README.txt
- Can now talk to servers that don't implement EHLO
- Fix bug that caused files with very long names to be created
- Fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/157104: move aside mail that's
  causing 5xx server responses.


3.5.0a2 (2007-10-23)
********************

- Cleaned up ``does_esmtp`` in faux SMTP connection classes provided by the
  tests.
- If the ``QueueProcessorThread`` is asked to stop while sending messages, do
  so after sending the current message; previously if there were many, many
  messages to send, the thread could stick around for quite a while.


3.5.0a1 (2007-10-23)
********************

- ``QueueProcessorThread`` now accepts an optional parameter *interval* for
  defining how often to process the mail queue (default is 3 seconds)

- Several ``QueueProcessorThreads`` (either in the same process, or multiple
  processes) can now deliver messages from a single maildir without duplicates
  being sent.

zope.sequencesort
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(No changes)

zope.server
~~~~~~~~~~~

3.6.2 (2010-06-11)
******************

- The log message "Exception during task" is no longer logged to the root
  logger but to zope.server.taskthreads.

3.6.1 (2009-10-07)
******************

- Made tests pass with current zope.publisher which restricts redirects to the
  current host by default.

3.6.0 (2009-05-27)
******************

- Moved some imports from test modules to their setUp to prevent
  failures when ZEO tests are run by the same testrunner

- Removed unused dependency on zope.deprecation.

- Remove old zpkg-related DEPENDENCIES.cfg file.

3.5.0 (2008-03-01)
******************

- Improve package meta-data.

- Fix of 599 error on conflict error in request
  see: http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope-dev/2008-January/030844.html

- Removed dependency on ZODB.

3.5.0a2 (2007-06-02)
********************

Made WSGI server really WSGI-compliant by adding variables to the
environment that are required by the spec.

3.5.0a1 (2007-06-02)
********************

Added a factory and entry point for PasteDeploy.

3.4 (2007-04-22)
****************

- Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to zope.server
  from Zope 3.4.0a1

- Made WSGI server really WSGI-compliant by adding variables to the
  environment that are required by the spec.

zope.session
~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.9.2 (2009-11-23)
******************

- Fix Python 2.4 hmac compatibility issue by only using hashlib in
  Python versions 2.5 and above.

- Use the CookieClientIdManager's secret as the hmac key instead of the
  message when constructing and verifying client ids.

- Make it possible to construct CookieClientIdManager passing cookie namespace
  and/or secret as constructor's arguments.

- Use zope.schema.fieldproperty.FieldProperty for "namespace" attribute of
  CookieClientIdManager, just like for other attributes in its interface.
  Also, make ICookieClientIdManager's "namespace" field an ASCIILine, so
  it accepts only non-unicode strings for cookie names.

3.9.1 (2009-04-20)
******************

- Restore compatibility with Python 2.4.

3.9.0 (2009-03-19)
******************

- Don't raise deprecation warnings on Python 2.6.

- Drop dependency on ``zope.annotation``. Instead, we make classes implement
  `IAttributeAnnotatable` in ZCML configuration, only if ``zope.annotation``
  is available. If your code relies on annotatable `CookieClientIdManager`
  and `PersistentSessionDataContainer` and you don't include the zcml classes
  configuration of this package, you'll need to use `classImplements` function
  from ``zope.interface`` to make those classes implement `IAttributeAnnotatable`
  again.

- Drop dependency on zope.app.http, use standard date formatting function
  from the ``email.utils`` module.

- Zope 3 application bootstrapping code for session utilities was moved into
  zope.app.appsetup package, thus drop dependency on zope.app.appsetup in this
  package.

- Drop testing dependencies, as we don't need anything behind zope.testing and
  previous dependencies was simply migrated from zope.app.session before.

- Remove zpkg files and zcml slugs.

- Update package's description a bit.

3.8.1 (2009-02-23)
******************

- Add an ability to set cookie effective domain for CookieClientIdManager.
  This is useful for simple cases when you have your application set up on
  one domain and you want your identification cookie be active for subdomains.

- Python 2.6 compatibility change. Encode strings before calling hmac.new()
  as the function no longer accepts the unicode() type.

3.8.0 (2008-12-31)
******************

- Add missing test dependency on ``zope.site`` and
  ``zope.app.publication``.

3.7.1 (2008-12-30)
******************

- Specify i18n_domain for titles in apidoc.zcml

- ZODB 3.9 no longer contains
  ZODB.utils.ConflictResolvingMappingStorage, fixed tests, so they
  work both with ZODB 3.8 and 3.9.


3.7.0 (2008-10-03)
******************

New features:

- Added a 'postOnly' option on CookieClientIdManagers to only allow setting
  the client id cookie on POST requests.  This is to further reduce risk from
  broken caches handing the same client id out to multiple users. (Of
  course, it doesn't help if caches are broken enough to cache POSTs.)

3.6.0 (2008-08-12)
******************

New features:

- Added a 'secure' option on CookieClientIdManagers to cause the secure
  set-cookie option to be used, which tells the browser not to send the
  cookie over http.

  This provides enhanced security for ssl-only applications.

- Only set the client-id cookie if it isn't already set and try to
  prevent the header from being cached.  This is to minimize risk from
  broken caches handing the same client id out to multiple users.

3.5.2 (2008-06-12)
******************

- Remove ConflictErrors caused on SessionData caused by setting
  ``lastAccessTime``.

3.5.1 (2008-04-30)
******************

- Split up the ZCML to make it possible to re-use more reasonably.

3.5.0 (2008-03-11)
******************

- Change the default session "resolution" to a sane value and document/test it.

zope.site
~~~~~~~~~

3.9.1 (2010-04-30)
******************

- Removed use of 'zope.testing.doctest' in favor of stdlib's 'doctest.

- Removed use of 'zope.testing.doctestunit' in favor of stdlib's 'doctest.

3.9.0 (2009-12-29)
******************

- Avoid a test dependency on zope.copypastemove by testing the correct
  persistent behavior of a site manager using the normal pickle module.

3.8.0 (2009-12-15)
******************

- Removed functional testing setup and dependency on zope.app.testing.

3.7.1 (2009-11-18)
******************

- Moved the zope.site.hooks functionality to zope.component.hooks as it isn't
  actually dealing with zope.site's concept of a site.

- Import ISite and IPossibleSite from zope.component after they were moved
  there from zope.location.

3.7.0 (2009-09-29)
******************

- Cleaned up the undeclared dependency on zope.app.publication by moving the
  two relevant subscriber registrations and their tests to that package.

- Dropped the dependency on zope.traversing which was only used to access
  zope.location functionality. Configure zope.location for some tests.

- Demoted zope.configuration to a testing dependency.

3.6.4 (2009-09-01)
******************

- Set __parent__ and __name__ in the LocalSiteManager's constructor
  after calling constructor of its superclasses, so __name__ doesn't
  get overwritten with empty string by the Components constructor.

- Don't set __parent__ and __name__ attributes of site manager in
  SiteManagerContainer's ``setSiteManager`` method, as they're
  already set for LocalSiteManager. Other site manager implementations
  are not required to have those attributes at all, so we're not
  adding them anymore.

3.6.3 (2009-07-27)
******************

- Propagate an ObjectRemovedEvent to the SiteManager upon removal of a
  SiteManagerContainer.

3.6.2 (2009-07-24)
******************

- Fixed tests to pass with latest packages.

- Removed failing test of persistent interfaces, since it did not test
  anything in this package and used the deprecated ``zodbcode`` module.

- Fix NameError when calling ``zope.site.testing.siteSetUp(site=True)``.

- The ``getNextUtility`` and ``queryNextUtility`` functions was moved to
  ``zope.component``.  While backward-compatibility imports are provided, it's
  strongly recommended to update your imports.

3.6.1 (2009-02-28)
******************

- Import symbols moved from zope.traversing to zope.location from the new
  location.

- Don't fail when changing component registry bases while moving ISite
  object to non-ISite object.

- Allow specify whether to create 'default' SiteManagementFolder on
  initializing LocalSiteManager. Use the ``default_folder`` argument.

- Add a containment constraint to the SiteManagementFolder that makes
  it only available to be contained in ILocalSiteManagers and other
  ISiteManagementFolders.

- Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org, as
  zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired.

- Remove old unused code. Update package description.

3.6.0 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container.

3.5.1 (2009-01-27)
******************

- Extracted from zope.app.component (trunk, 3.5.1 under development)
  as part of an effort to clean up dependencies between Zope packages.

zope.size
~~~~~~~~~

3.4.1 (2009-09-10)
******************

- Added support to bootstrap on Jython.

- Added docstrings

- Beautify package's README and include CHANGES into the description.

- Changed package's url to PyPI instead of Subversion.

zope.structuredtext
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.5.0 (2010-04-30)
******************

- Updated docs to conform to ZTK / Sphinx usage.

- LP #120376:  Output valid html for non-ASCII characters.

zope.tal
~~~~~~~~

3.5.2 (2009-10-31)
******************

- In talgettext.POEngine.translate, print a warning if a msgid already exists
  in the domain with a different default.


3.5.1 (2009-03-08)
******************

- Updated tests of "bad" entities for compatibility with the stricter
  HTMLParser module shipped with Python 2.6.x.


3.5.0 (2008-06-06)
******************

- Removed artificial addition of a trailing newline if the output doesn't end
  in one; this allows the template source to be the full specification of what
  should be included.
  (See https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/218706.)

zope.tales
~~~~~~~~~~

3.5.1 (2010-04-30)
******************

- Removed use of 'zope.testing.doctestunit' in favor of stdlib's 'doctest.

3.5.0 (2010-01-01)
******************

- Ported the lazy expression from Products.PageTemplates.

zope.testbrowser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.9.0 (2010-05-17)
******************

- LP #568806: Update dependency ``mechanize >= 0.2.0``, which now includes
  the ``ClientForm`` APIs.  Remove use of ``urllib2`` APIs (incompatible
  with ``mechanize 0.2.0``) in favor of ``mechanize`` equivalents.
  Thanks to John J. Lee for the patch.

- Use stdlib ``doctest`` module, instead of ``zope.testing.doctest``.

- **Caution:** This version is no longer fully compatible with Python 2.4:
  ``handleErrors = False`` no longer works.


3.8.1 (2010-04-19)
******************

- Pinned dependency on mechanize to prevent use of the upcoming
  0.2.0 release before we have time to adjust to its API changes.

- LP #98396: testbrowser resolves relative URLs incorrectly.

3.8.0 (2010-03-05)
******************

- Added ``follow`` convenience method which gets and follows a link.

3.7.0 (2009-12-17)
******************

- Moved zope.app.testing dependency into the scope of the PublisherConnection
  class. Zope2 specifies its own PublisherConnection which isn't dependent on
  zope.app.testing.

- Fixed LP #419119: return None when the browser has no contents instead of
  raising an exception.

3.7.0a1 (2009-08-29)
********************

- Remove dependency on zope.app.publisher in favor of zope.browserpage,
  zope.browserresource and zope.ptresource.

- Remove dependencies on zope.app.principalannotation and zope.securitypolicy
  by using the simple PermissiveSecurityPolicy. We aren't testing security
  in our tests.

- Replaced the testing dependency on zope.app.zcmlfiles with explicit
  dependencies of a minimal set of packages.

- Remove unneeded zope.app.authentication from ftesting.zcml.

- Test dependency on zope.securitypolicy instead of its app variant.


3.6.0a2 (2009-01-31)
********************

- Test dependency on zope.site.folder instead of zope.app.folder.

- Remove useless test dependency in zope.app.component.


3.6.0a1 (2009-01-08)
********************

- Author e-mail to zope-dev rather than zope3-dev.

- New lines are no longer stripped in XML and HTML code contained in a
  textarea; fix requires ClientForm >= 0.2.10 (LP #268139).

- Added ``cookies`` attribute to browser for easy manipulation of browser
  cookies.  See brief example in main documentation, plus new ``cookies.txt``
  documentation.


3.5.1 (2008-10-10)
******************

- Provide a work around for a mechanize/urllib2 bug on Python 2.6
  missing 'timeout' attribute on 'Request' base class.

- Provide a work around for a mechanize/urllib2 bug in creating request
  objects that won't handle fragment URLs correctly.


3.5.0 (2008-03-30)
******************

- Added a zope.testbrowser.testing.Browser.post method that allows
  tests to supply a body and a content type.  This is handy for
  testing Ajax requests with non-form input (e.g. JSON).

- Remove vendor import of mechanize.

- Fix bug that caused HTTP exception tracebacks to differ between version 3.4.0
  and 3.4.1.

- Workaround for bug in Python Cookie.SimpleCookie when handling unicode
  strings.

- Fix bug introduced in 3.4.1 that created incompatible tracebacks in doctests.
  This necessitated adding a patched mechanize to the source tree; patches have
  been sent to the mechanize project.

- Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/149517 by adding zope.interface and
  zope.schema as real dependencies

- Fix browser.getLink documentation that was not updated since the last API
  modification.

- Move tests for fixed bugs to a separate file.

- Removed non-functional and undocumented code intended to help test servers
  using virtual hosting.


zope.testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.9.5 (2010-05-19)
******************

- LP #579019: When layers were run in parallel, their tearDown was not
  called. Additionally, the first layer which was run in the main
  thread did not have it's tearDown called either.

- Deprecated zope.testing.testrunner and zope.testing.exceptions. They have
  been moved to a separate zope.testrunner module, and will be removed from
  zope.testing in 4.0.0, together with zope.testing.doctest.

3.9.4 (2010-04-13)
******************

- LP #560259: Fix subunit output formatter to handle layer setup
  errors.

- LP #399394:  Added a ``--stop-on-error`` / ``--stop`` / ``-x`` option to
  the testrunner.

- LP #498162:  Added a ``--pdb`` alias for the existing ``--post-mortem``
  / ``-D`` option to the testrunner.

- LP #547023:  Added a ``--version`` option to the testrunner.

- Added tests for LP #144569 and #69988.

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/69988

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/144569

3.9.3 (2010-03-26)
******************

- zope.testing.renormalizer no longer imports zope.testing.doctest, which
  caused deprecation warnings.

- Fix testrunner-layers-ntd.txt to suppress output to sys.stderr.

- Suppress zope.testing.doctest deprecation warning when running
  zope.testing's own test suite.

3.9.2 (2010-03-15)
******************

- Fixed broken ``from zope.testing.doctest import *``

3.9.1 (2010-03-15)
******************

- No changes; reuploaded to fix broken 3.9.0 release on PyPI.

3.9.0 (2010-03-12)
******************

- Modified the testrunner to use the standard Python doctest module instead of
  the deprecated zope.testing.doctest.

- Fix testrunner-leaks.txt to use the run_internal helper, so that
  sys.exit() isn't triggered during the test run.

- Added support for conditionally using a subunit-based output
  formatter upon request if subunit and testtools are available. Patch
  contributed by Jonathan Lange.

3.8.7 (2010-01-26)
******************

- Downgraded the zope.testing.doctest deprecation warning into a
  PendingDeprecationWarning.

3.8.6 (2009-12-23)
******************

- Added MANIFEST.in and reuploaded to fix broken 3.8.5 release on PyPI.


3.8.5 (2009-12-23)
******************

- Added DocFileSuite, DocTestSuite, debug_src and debug back BBB imports
  back into zope.testing.doctestunit; apparently many packages still import
  them from there!

- Made zope.testing.doctest and zope.testing.doctestunit emit deprecation
  warnings: use the stdlib doctest instead.


3.8.4 (2009-12-18)
******************

- Fixed missing imports and undefined variables reported by pyflakes,
  adding tests to exercise the blind spots.

- Cleaned up unused imports reported by pyflakes.

- Added two new options to generate randomly ordered list of tests and to
  select a specific order of tests.

- RENormalizing checkers can be combined via ``+`` now:
  ``checker1 + checker2`` creates a checker with the transformations of both
  checkers.

- Test fixes for Python 2.7.

3.8.3 (2009-09-21)
******************

- Avoid a split() call or we get test failures when running from a directory
  with spaces in it.

- Fix testrunner behavior on Windows for -j2 (or greater) combined with -v
  (or greater).

3.8.2 (2009-09-15)
******************

- Removing hotshot profiler when using Python 2.6. That makes zope.testing
  compatible with Python 2.6


3.8.1 (2009-08-12)
******************

- Avoid hardcoding sys.argv[0] as script;
  allow, for instance, Zope 2's `bin/instance test` (LP#407916).

- Produce a clear error message when a subprocess doesn't follow the
  zope.testing.testrunner protocol (LP#407916).

- Do not unnecessarily squelch verbose output in a subprocess when there are
  not multiple subprocesses.

- Do not unnecessarily batch subprocess output, which can stymie automated and
  human processes for identifying hung tests.

- Include incremental output when there are multiple subprocesses and a
  verbosity of -vv or greater is requested.  This again is not batched,
  supporting automated processes and humans looking for hung tests.


3.8.0 (2009-07-24)
******************

- Testrunner automatically picks up descendants of unittest.TestCase in test
  modules, so you don't have to provide a test_suite() anymore.


3.7.7 (2009-07-15)
******************

- Clean up support for displaying tracebacks with supplements by turning it
  into an always-enabled feature and making the dependency on zope.exceptions
  explicit.

- Fix #251759: Test runner descended into directories that aren't Python
  packages.

- Code cleanups.


3.7.6 (2009-07-02)
******************

- Add zope-testrunner console_scripts entry point. This exposes a
  zope-testrunner binary with default installs allowing the testrunner to be
  run from the command line.

3.7.5 (2009-06-08)
******************

- Fix bug when running subprocesses on Windows.

- The option REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE (command line option "-1") is now
  respected even when a doctest declares its own REPORTING_FLAGS, such as
  REPORT_NDIFF.

- Fixed bug that broke readline with pdb when using doctest
  (see http://bugs.python.org/issue5727).

- Made tests pass on Windows and Linux at the same time.


3.7.4 (2009-05-01)
******************

- Filenames of doctest examples now contain the line number and not
  only the example number. So a stack trace in pdb tells the exact
  line number of the current example. This fixes
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/339813

- Colorization of doctest output correctly handles blank lines.


3.7.3 (2009-04-22)
******************

- Better deal with rogue threads by always exiting with status so even
  spinning daemon threads won't block the runner from exiting. This deprecated
  the ``--with-exit-status`` option.


3.7.2 (2009-04-13)
******************

- fix test failure on Python 2.4 because of slight difference in the way
  coverage is reported (__init__ files with only a single comment line are now
  not reported)
- fixed bug that caused the test runner to hang when running subprocesses (as a
  result Python 2.3 is no longer supported).
- there is apparently a bug in Python 2.6 (related to
  http://bugs.python.org/issue1303673) that causes the profile tests to fail.
- added explanitory notes to buildout.cfg about how to run the tests with
  multiple versions of Python


3.7.1 (2008-10-17)
******************

- The setupstack temporary-directory support now properly handles
  read-only files by making them writable before removing them.


3.7.0 (2008-09-22)
******************

- Added an alterate setuptools / distutils commands for running all tests
  using our testrunner.  See 'zope.testing.testrunner.eggsupport:ftest'.

- Added a setuptools-compatible test loader which skips tests with layers:
  the testrunner used by 'setup.py test' doesn't know about them, and those
  tests then fail.  See 'zope.testing.testrunner.eggsupport:SkipLayers'.

- Added support for Jython, when a garbage collector call is sent.

- Added support to bootstrap on Jython.

- Fixed NameError in StartUpFailure.

- Open doctest files in universal mode, so that packages released in Windoes
  can be tested in Linux, for example.


3.6.0 (2008/07/10)
******************

- Added -j option to parallel tests run in subprocesses.

- RENormalizer accepts plain Python callables.

- Added --slow-test option.

- Added --no-progress and --auto-progress options.

- Complete refactoring of the test runner into multiple code files and a more
  modular (pipeline-like) architecture.

- Unified unit tests with the layer support by introducing a real unit test
  layer.

- Added a doctest for ``zope.testing.module``. There were several bugs
  that were fixed:

  * ``README.txt`` was a really bad default argument for the module
    name, as it is not a proper dotted name. The code would
    immediately fail as it would look for the ``txt`` module in the
    ``README`` package. The default is now ``__main__``.

  * The tearDown function did not clean up the ``__name__`` entry in the
    global dictionary.

- Fix a bug that caused a SubprocessError to be generated if a subprocess
  sent any output to stderr.

- Fix a bug that caused the unit tests to be skipped if run in a subprocess.


3.5.1 (2007/08/14)
******************

Bugs Fixed
++++++++++

- Post-mortem debugging wasn't invoked for layer-setup failures.

3.5.0 (2007/07/19)
******************

New Features
++++++++++++

- The test runner now works on Python 2.5.

- Added support for cProfile.

- Added output colorizing (-c option).

- Added --hide-secondary-failures and --show-secondary-failures options
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/115454).

Bugs Fixed
++++++++++

- Fix some problems with Unicode in doctests.

- Fix "Error reading from subprocess" errors on Unix-like systems.

3.4 (2007/03/29)
****************

New Features
++++++++++++

- Added exit-with-status support (supports use with buildbot and
  zc.recipe.testing)

- Added a small framework for automating set up and tear down of
  doctest tests. See setupstack.txt.

Bugs Fixed
++++++++++

- Fix testrunner-wo-source.txt and testrunner-errors.txt to run with a
  read-only source tree.

3.0 (2006/09/20)
****************

- Updated the doctest copy with text-file encoding support.

- Added logging-level support to loggingsuppport module.

- At verbosity-level 1, dots are not output continuously, without any
  line breaks.

- Improved output when the inability to tear down a layer causes tests
  to be run in a subprocess.

- Made zope.exception required only if the zope_tracebacks extra is
  requested.

2.x.y (???)
***********

- Fix the test coverage. If a module, for example `interfaces`, was in an
  ignored directory/package, then if a module of the same name existed in a
  covered directory/package, then it was also ignored there, because the
  ignore cache stored the result by module name and not the filename of the
  module.

2.0 (2006/01/05)
****************

- Corresponds to the version of the zope.testing package shipped as part of
  the Zope 3.2.0 release.

zope.thread
~~~~~~~~~~~

(No changes)

zope.traversing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.13 (2010-07-09)
*****************

- When a ``__parent__`` attribute is available on an object, it is
  always used for absolute URL construction, and no ILocation adapter
  lookup is performed for it. This was the previous behavior but was
  broken (around 3.5?) due to dependency refactoring. 
 
  If the object provides no ``__parent__`` then an ILocation adapter
  lookup will be performed. This will always succeed as zope.location
  provides a default LocationProxy for everything, but more specific
  ILocation adapters can also be provided.

3.12.1 (2010-04-30)
*******************

- Removed use of 'zope.testing.doctestunit' in favor of stdlib's doctest.

3.12.0 (2009-12-29)
*******************

- Avoid testing dependencies on zope.securitypolicies and
  zope.principalregistry.

3.11.0 (2009-12-27)
*******************

- Removed testing dependency on zope.app.publication.

3.10.0 (2009-12-16)
*******************

- Removed stray test claiming a no longer existing dependency on
  zope.app.applicationcontrol.

- Refactored functional tests to loose dependency on both zope.app.appsetup
  and zope.app.testing.

- Simplified tests for the browser sub-package by using PlacelessSetup from
  zope.component.testing instead of zope.app.testing.

- Simplified test_dependencies module by using zope.configuration instead of
  zope.app.testing.functional.

- Removed testing dependency on zope.app.publisher.

- Replaced testing dependency on zope.app.security with zope.securitypolicy.

- Removed testing dependency on zope.app.zcmlfiles in favor of more explicit
  dependencies.

- Removed testing dependency on zope.app.component.

- Replaced a test dependency on zope.app.zptpage with a dependency on
  zope.pagetemplate.

3.9.0 (2009-12-15)
******************

- Moved IBeforeTraverseEvent from zope.app.publication into this package,
  as we already deal with publication traversal.

3.8.0 (2009-09-29)
******************

- In zope.traversing.api.getParent(), try to delegate to
  zope.location.interfaces.ILocationInfo.getParent(), analogous to
  getParents(). Keep returning the traversal parent as a fallback.

- Brought ITraverser back from zope.location where it had been moved to invert
  the package interdependency, but is no longer used now.

3.7.2 (2009-08-29)
******************

- Made virtual hosting tests compatible with zope.publisher 3.9. Redirecting
  to a different host requires an explicit `trusted` redirect now.

3.7.1 (2009-06-16)
******************

- AbsoluteURL now implements the fact that __call__ returns the same as __str__
  in a manner that it applies for subclasses, too, so they only have to override
  __str__ and not both.

3.7.0 (2009-05-23)
******************

- Moved the publicationtraverse module to zope.traversing, removing the
  zope.app.publisher -> zope.app.publication dependency (which was a
  cycle).

- Look up the application controller through a utility registration
  rather than a direct reference.

3.6.0 (2009-04-06)
******************

- Change configure.zcml to not depend on zope.app.component.

- This release includes the BBB-incompatible ``zope.publisher.skinnable``
  change from 3.5.3.

3.5.4 (2009-04-06)
******************

- Revert BBB-incompatible use of ``zope.publisher.skinnable``:  that
  change belongs in a 3.6.0 release, because it requires a BBB-incompatible
  version of ``zope.publisher``.

3.5.3 (2009-03-10)
******************

- Use applySkin from new location. zope.publisher.skinnable instead of
  zope.publisher.browser.

- Use IAbsoluteURL lookup instead of the "absolute_url" view in the
  recursive AbsoluteURL adapters (LP: #338101).

3.5.2 (2009-02-04)
******************

- The RootPhysicallyLocatable is not the same as
  LocationPhysicallyLocatable now in zope.location. Fix the import
  and testing setups.

3.5.1 (2009-02-02)
******************

- The ``RootPhysicallyLocatable`` adapter has been superseded by the
  refactored ``zope.location.traversing.LocationPhysicallyLocatable``
  that we depend on since 3.5.0a4.

  Remove the adapter and its registration, and making its import place
  pointing to ``zope.location.traversing.LocationPhysicallyLocatable``
  to maintain backward-compatibility.

  This also fixes a bug introduced in version 3.5.0a4 when trying to
  call ``getParents`` function for the root object.

- Use direct imports instead of compatibility ones for things that were
  moved to ``zope.location``.

- Remove the ``zope.traversing.interfaces.INamespaceHandler`` interface,
  as it seems not to be used for years.

- Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org instead
  of retired zope3-dev at zope.org

3.5.0 (2009-01-31)
******************

- Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container.

- Use zope.site instead of zope.app.folder in the unit tests.

- Reduced, but did not eliminate, test dependencies on zope.app.component.

3.5.0a4 (2008-08-01)
********************

- Reverse dependencies between zope.location and zope.traversing.

- Updated (test) dependencies and tests to expect and work with a spec
  compliant TAL interpreter as available in zope.tal >= 3.5.0.
- Fixed deprecation warning caused by using an old module name for
  ZopeSecurityPolicy in ftesting.zcml
- Made sure traversing doesn't raise an TypeError but a TraversalError when the
  traversal step before yielded a string.


3.5.0a3 (2007-12-28)
********************

- backed out the controversial `++skin++` traverser for XML-RPC.


3.5.0a2 (2007-11-28)
********************

- ported 3.4.1a1 to trunk

  - Do not use unicode strings to set the application server in the virtual
    host namespace. This caused absolute_url to create unicode URL's.

- Added a traverer for ++skin++ for XMLRPC skins (IXMLRPCSkinType). This also
  means that the normal ++skin++ namespace handler is only bound to
  IBrowserRequest. 

- Resolved the dependency on zope.app.applicationcontrol by importing the
  application controller only if the package is available.


3.4.1a1 (2007-11-13)
********************

Do not use unicode strings to set the application server in the virtual host
namespace. This caused absolute_url to create unicode URL's.


3.4.0 (2007-09-29)
******************

No further changes since 3.4.0a1.

3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
********************

Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to zope.traversing
from Zope 3.4.0a1

zope.viewlet
~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.7.2 (2010-05-25)
******************

- Fixed unit tests broken under Python 2.4 by the switch to the standard
  library ``doctest`` module.

3.7.1 (2010-04-30)
******************

- Removed use of 'zope.testing.doctest' in favor of stdlib's 'doctest.

- Fixed dubious quoting in metadirectives.py. Closes
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/143774.

3.7.0 (2009-12-22)
******************

- Depend on zope.browserpage in favor of zope.app.pagetemplate.

3.6.1 (2009-08-29)
******************

- Fixed unit tests in README.txt.

3.6.0 (2009-08-02)
******************

- Optimize the the script tag for the JS viewlet. This makes YSlow happy.

- Remove ZCML slugs and old zpkg-related files.

- Drop all testing dependncies except ``zope.testing``.


3.5.0 (2009-01-26)
******************

- Removed the dependency on `zope.app.publisher` by moving four
  simple helper functions into this package and making the interface
  for describing the ZCML content provider directive explicit.

- Typo fix in CSSViewlet docstring.
