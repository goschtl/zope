Introduction
------------

In the :ref:`started-getting` chapter you learned how to install
BlueBream and create a new project using the ``bluebream`` project
template.  In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a simple
ticket collector application.  This will help you to get more
familiar with the concepts of BlueBream.

Here are the user stories for the ticket collector application:

1. Any number of tickets can be added to one collector.

2. Each new ticket will have a description and one initial
   comment.

3. Additional comments can be added to tickets.

This is the first part of the tutorial.  After completing this
chapter, you should be able to:

- Understand the project directory structure
- Use Buildout and edit Buildout configuration
- Create content objects and interfaces
- Use the form generation tool (zope.formlib)

.. note::

   The examples in this documentation can be downloaded from here:

Starting a new project
----------------------

Using the *bluebream* project template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section we will create the directory layout for our ticket
collector application.  I will assume that you have already installed
``bluebream`` using the ``easy_install bluebream`` command as
mentioned in the :ref:`started-getting` chapter.  We are going to use
the project name ``ticketcollector`` and the Python package name
``tc.main``.  This will create a project with egg/distribution name
``ticketcollector``, ``tc`` as a namespace package and ``main`` as a
Python sub-package.  Let's create the project directory layout for
``ticketcollector``::

  $ paster create -t bluebream

  Selected and implied templates:
    bluebream#bluebream  A BlueBream project, base template

  Enter project name: ticketcollector
  Variables:
    egg:      ticketcollector
    package:  ticketcollector
    project:  ticketcollector
  Enter python_package (Main Python package (with namespace, if any)) ['ticketcollector']: tc.main
  Enter interpreter (Name of custom Python interpreter) ['breampy']:
  Enter version (Version (like 0.1)) ['0.1']:
  Enter description (One-line description of the package) ['']: Ticket Collector
  Enter long_description (Multi-line description (in reST)) ['']: An issue tracking application
  Enter keywords (Space-separated keywords/tags) ['']:
  Enter author (Author name) ['']: Baiju M
  Enter author_email (Author email) ['']: baiju@example.com
  Enter url (URL of homepage) ['']:
  Enter license_name (License name) ['']: ZPL
  Enter zip_safe (True/False: if the package can be distributed as a .zip file) [False]:
  Creating template bluebream
  Creating directory ./ticketcollector

  Your project has been created! Now, you want to:
  1) put the generated files under version control
  2) run: python boostrap.py
  3) run: ./bin/buildout


As you can see above, we have provided most of the project details.
The values you provided here may be changed later, however changing
the Python package name may not be as easy as changing other values,
because the Python package name might be referred to in many places
in our code later.

Organize the new package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you change directory to ``ticketcollector`` you can see a few
directories and files::

  jack@computer:/projects/ticketcollector$ ls -CF
  bootstrap.py  debug.ini   etc/      src/  versions.cfg
  buildout.cfg  deploy.ini  setup.py  var/

Once the project directory layout is ready you can add it to your
version control system.  You **should not** add the
``src/ticketcollector.egg-info`` directory as it is generated
automatically by setuptools.  Here is an example using `bzr
<http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/>`_::

  jack@computer:/projects/ticketcollector$ rm -fr src/ticketcollector.egg-info/
  jack@computer:/projects/ticketcollector$ bzr init
  Created a standalone tree (format: 2a)
  jack@computer:/projects/ticketcollector$ bzr add *
  adding bootstrap.py
  adding buildout.cfg
  adding debug.ini
  ...
  jack@computer:/projects/ticketcollector$ bzr ci -m "Initial import"
  Committing to: /projects/ticketcollector/
  added bootstrap.py
  added buildout.cfg
  ...
  Committed revision 1.

Adding the project to a version control system is an optional but
recommended step.  You now have a valid source code distribution of
your project that, after building, will produce a running
application.  The project is now completely independent of the
``bluebream`` distribution, it's only purpose is to help us get to
this point.  The project now contains everything required to install
the dependencies from the Internet and to set-up the application.

Bootstrapping the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next step is to install Buildout.  The purpose of Buildout is to
automate the building of Python applications from their bare source
code form.  The only basic requirement for Buildout is a Python
installation.  BlueBream provides a bootstrapping script to install
Buildout and to set up the project directory for running it.  This
bootstrap script is named ``bootstrap.py`` and will do these things:

- Download and install the ``distribute`` distribution from PyPI which
  contains the forked ``setuptools`` Python package inside.

- Download and install the ``zc.buildout`` distribution from PyPI.

- Create the directory structure eg:- bin/ eggs/ parts/ develop-eggs/

- Create a script inside the ``bin`` directory named ``buildout``

When you run ``bootstrap.py`` you can see that it creates a few
directories and the ``bin/buildout`` script as mentioned earlier::

  jack@computer:/projects/ticketcollector$ python bootstrap.py
  Creating directory '/projects/ticketcollector/bin'.
  Creating directory '/projects/ticketcollector/parts'.
  Creating directory '/projects/ticketcollector/develop-eggs'.
  Creating directory '/projects/ticketcollector/eggs'.
  Generated script '/projects/ticketcollector/bin/buildout'.

- The ``bin`` directory is where Buildout installs all the executable
  scripts.

- The ``eggs`` directory is where Buildout installs Python eggs

- The ``parts`` is where Buildout saves all output generated by buildout.
  Buildout expects you to not change anything inside the parts directory
  as it is auto generated by Buildout.

- The ``develop-eggs`` directory is where Buildout saves links to all
  locally developed Python eggs.

Buildout configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After bootstrapping the project you can build your application.  All
the steps you done so far are only required once per project, but
running buildout is required whenever you make changes to the
buildout configuration.  You are now ready to run ``bin/buildout`` to
build the application, but before doing this, let's have a look at
the content of ``buildout.cfg``::

  [buildout]
  develop = .
  extends = versions.cfg
  parts = app
          test

  [app]
  recipe = zc.recipe.egg
  eggs = ticketcollector
         z3c.evalexception>=2.0
         Paste
         PasteScript
         PasteDeploy
  interpreter = breampy

  [test]
  recipe = zc.recipe.testrunner
  eggs = ticketcollector

The buildout configuration file is divided into multiple sections
called *parts*.  The main part is called ``[buildout]``, and it
appears as the first part in the listing above.  Each part will be
handled by the Buildout plugin mechanism, called recipes, except for
``[buildout]``.  ``[buildout]`` is handled as a special case by
Buildout since it contains general settings.

Let's look at the main ``[buildout]`` part::

  [buildout]
  develop = .
  extends = versions.cfg
  parts = app
          test

The first option (``develop``) tells buildout that the current
directory is a Python distribution source, i.e., it contains a
``setup.py`` file.  Buildout will inspect the ``setup.py`` and create
a develop egg link inside the ``develop-eggs`` directory.  The link
file should contain the path to the location where the Python package
is residing.  So buildout will make sure that the packages are always
importable.  The value of the ``develop`` option could be a relative
path, as given above, or absolute path to some directory.  You can
also add multiple lines to the ``develop`` option with different
paths.

The ``extends`` option tells buildout to include the full content of
the ``versions.cfg`` file as part the configuration.  The
``versions.cfg`` is another Buildout configuration file of the same
format as buildout.cfg and contains the release numbers of different
dependencies.  You can add multiple lines to the ``extends`` option
to include multiple configuration files.

The ``parts`` option lists all the parts to be built by Buildout.
Buildout expects a recipe for each of the parts listed here.

Now let's look at the ``app`` part::

  [app]
  recipe = zc.recipe.egg
  eggs = ticketcollector
         z3c.evalexception>=2.0
         Paste
         PasteScript
         PasteDeploy
  interpreter = breampy

This part takes care of all the eggs required for the application to
function.  The `zc.recipe.egg
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.recipe.egg>`_ is an advanced Buildout
recipe with many features for dealing with eggs.  Most of the
dependencies will come as part of the main application egg.  The
option ``eggs`` lists all the eggs.  The first egg,
``ticketcollector`` is the main locally developed egg.  The last
option, ``interpreter`` specifies the name of the custom interpreter
created by this part.  The custom interpreter contains the paths to
all eggs listed here and their dependencies, so that you can import
any module which is listed as a dependency.

The last part creates the test runner::

  [test]
  recipe = zc.recipe.testrunner
  eggs = ticketcollector

The testrunner recipe creates a test runner using the
``zope.testing`` module.  The only mandatory option is ``eggs`` where
you can specify the eggs.

Building the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now you can run the ``bin/buildout`` command.  It will take some time
to download all packages from PyPI.  When you run buildout, it will
show something like this::

  jack@computer:/projects/ticketcollector$ ./bin/buildout
  Develop: '/projects/ticketcollector/.'
  Installing app.
  Generated script '/projects/ticketcollector/bin/paster'.
  Generated interpreter '/projects/ticketcollector/bin/breampy'.
  Installing zope_conf.
  Installing test.
  Generated script '/projects/ticketcollector/bin/test'.

In the above example, all eggs are already available in the eggs
folder. If they are not already available, they will be downloaded
and installed.  The buildout also created three more scripts inside
the ``bin`` directory.

- The ``paster`` command can be used to run a web server.

- The ``breampy`` command provides a custom Python interpreter with
  all eggs included in its path.

- The ``test`` command can be used to run the test runner.

Now we have a project structure which will allow us to continue
developing our application.

PasteDeploy configuration
-----------------------------

BlueBream use WSGI to run the server using PasteDeploy.  There are
two PasteDeploy configuration files: one for deployment
(``deploy.ini``), another for development (``debug.ini``).

We will now examine the contents of ``debug.ini``::

  [app:main]
  use = egg:ticketcollector

  [server:main]
  use = egg:Paste#http
  host = 127.0.0.1
  port = 8080

  [DEFAULT]
  # set the name of the zope.conf file
  zope_conf = %(here)s/etc/zope.conf

First let's look at the ``[app:main]`` section::

  [app:main]
  use = egg:ticketcollector

The ``[app:main]`` section specifies the egg to be used.  PasteDeploy
expects a ``paste.app_factory`` entry point to be defined in the egg.
If you look at the ``setup.py`` file, you can see that it is defined
like this::

      [paste.app_factory]
      main = tc.main.startup:application_factory

The name of entry point should be ``main``.  Otherwise, it should be
explicitly mentioned in configuration file (``debug.ini`` &
``deploy.ini``).  For example, if the definition is::

      [paste.app_factory]
      testapp = tc.main.startup:application_factory

The PasteDeploy configuration should be changed like this::

  [app:main]
  use = egg:ticketcollector#testapp

The second section (``[server:main]``) specifies the WSGI server::

  [server:main]
  use = egg:Paste#http
  host = 127.0.0.1
  port = 8080

You can change host name, port and the WSGI server itself from this
section.  In oder to use any other WSGI server, it should be included
in the dependency list in your Buildoout configuration.

The last section (``[DEFAULT]``) is where you specify default
values::

  [DEFAULT]
  # set the name of the zope.conf file
  zope_conf = %(here)s/etc/zope.conf

The WSGI application defined in ``tc.main.startup`` expects the
``zope_conf`` option defined in the ``[DEFAULT]`` section.  So, this
option is mandatory.  This option specifies the path of the main zope
configuration file. We will look at zope configuration in greater
detail in the next section.

The ``debug.ini`` contains configuration options which are useful for
debugging::

  [loggers]
  keys = root, wsgi

  [handlers]
  keys = console, accesslog

  [formatters]
  keys = generic, accesslog

  [formatter_generic]
  format = %(asctime)s %(levelname)s [%(name)s] %(message)s

  [formatter_accesslog]
  format = %(message)s

  [handler_console]
  class = StreamHandler
  args = (sys.stderr,)
  level = ERROR
  formatter = generic

  [handler_accesslog]
  class = FileHandler
  args = (os.path.join('var', 'log', 'access.log'),
          'a')
  level = INFO
  formatter = accesslog

  [logger_root]
  level = INFO
  handlers = console

  [logger_wsgi]
  level = INFO
  handlers = accesslog
  qualname = wsgi
  propagate = 0

  [filter:translogger]
  use = egg:Paste#translogger
  setup_console_handler = False
  logger_name = wsgi

  [filter-app:main]
  # Change the last part from 'ajax' to 'pdb' for a post-mortem debugger
  # on the console:
  use = egg:z3c.evalexception#ajax
  next = zope

  [app:zope]
  use = egg:ticketcollector
  filter-with = translogger

  [server:main]
  use = egg:Paste#http
  host = 127.0.0.1
  port = 8080

  [DEFAULT]
  # set the name of the debug zope.conf file
  zope_conf = %(here)s/etc/zope-debug.conf

The debug configuration uses ``filter-app`` instead of ``app`` to
include WSGI middlewares.  Currently only one middleware
(``z3c.evalexception#ajax``) is included.  You can look into
PastDeploy documentation for more information about the other
sections.  The Zope configuration file specified here
(``etc/zope-debug.conf``) is different from the deployment
configuration.

Zope configuration
----------------------

Similar to PasteDeploy configuration, there are two Zope
configuration files: ``etc/zope.conf`` and ``etc/zope-debug.conf``.

This is the content of ``etc/zope.conf``::

  # Identify the component configuration used to define the site:
  site-definition etc/site.zcml

  <zodb>

    <filestorage>
      path var/filestorage/Data.fs
      blob-dir var/blob
    </filestorage>

  # Uncomment this if you want to connect to a ZEO server instead:
  #  <zeoclient>
  #    server localhost:8100
  #    storage 1
  #    # ZEO client cache, in bytes
  #    cache-size 20MB
  #    # Uncomment to have a persistent disk cache
  #    #client zeo1
  #  </zeoclient>
  </zodb>

  <eventlog>
    # This sets up logging to both a file and to standard output (STDOUT).
    # The "path" setting can be a relative or absolute filesystem path or
    # the tokens STDOUT or STDERR.

    <logfile>
      path var/log/z3.log
      formatter zope.exceptions.log.Formatter
    </logfile>

    <logfile>
      path STDOUT
      formatter zope.exceptions.log.Formatter
    </logfile>
  </eventlog>

From the ``zope.conf`` file, you can specify the main ZCML file to be
loaded (site definition).  All paths are specified as relative to the
top-level directory where the PasteDeploy configuration file resides.

The site definition
-------------------

BlueBream use ZCML for application specific configuration.  ZCML is
an XML-based declarative configuration language.  As you have seen
already in ``zope.conf`` the main configuration is located at
``etc/site.zcml``.  Here is the default listing::

  <configure
     xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
     xmlns:browser="http://namespaces.zope.org/browser">

    <include package="zope.component" file="meta.zcml" />
    <include package="zope.security" file="meta.zcml" />
    <include package="zope.publisher" file="meta.zcml" />
    <include package="zope.i18n" file="meta.zcml" />
    <include package="zope.browserresource" file="meta.zcml" />
    <include package="zope.browsermenu" file="meta.zcml" />
    <include package="zope.browserpage" file="meta.zcml" />
    <include package="zope.securitypolicy" file="meta.zcml" />
    <include package="zope.principalregistry" file="meta.zcml" />
    <include package="zope.app.publication" file="meta.zcml" />
    <include package="zope.app.form.browser" file="meta.zcml" />
    <include package="zope.app.container.browser" file="meta.zcml" />
    <include package="zope.app.pagetemplate" file="meta.zcml" />
    <include package="zope.app.publisher.xmlrpc" file="meta.zcml" />

    <include package="zope.browserresource" />
    <include package="zope.copypastemove" />
    <include package="zope.publisher" />
    <include package="zope.component" />
    <include package="zope.traversing" />
    <include package="zope.site" />
    <include package="zope.annotation" />
    <include package="zope.container" />
    <include package="zope.componentvocabulary" />
    <include package="zope.formlib" />
    <include package="zope.app.appsetup" />
    <include package="zope.app.security" />
    <include package="zope.app.publication" />
    <include package="zope.app.form.browser" />
    <include package="zope.app.basicskin" />
    <include package="zope.browsermenu" />
    <include package="zope.principalregistry" />
    <include package="zope.authentication" />
    <include package="zope.securitypolicy" />
    <include package="zope.login" />
    <include package="zope.session" />
    <include package="zope.app.zcmlfiles" file="menus.zcml" />
    <include package="zope.app.authentication" />
    <include package="zope.app.security.browser" />
    <include package="zope.traversing.browser" />
    <include package="zope.app.pagetemplate" />
    <include package="zope.app.schema" />

    <include package="tc.main" />

  </configure>

The main configuration, ``site.zcml`` contains references to other
configuration files specific to packages.  The ZCML has some
directives like `include``, ``page``, ``defaultView`` etc. available
through various XML-namespaces.  In the ``site.zcml`` the default
XML-namespace is ``http://namespaces.zope.org/zope``.  If you look at
the top of site.zcml, you can see the XML-namespace refered to like
this::

  <configure
   xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope">

The ``include`` directive is available in
``http://namespaces.zope.org/zope`` namespace.  If you look at other
configuration files you can see some other namespaces, like
``http://namespaces.zope.org/browser``, which contains directives
like ``page``.

At the end of ``site.zcml``, project specific configuration files are
included.  For example, the following directive::

  <include package="tc.main" />

will ensure that the file ``src/tc/collector/configure.zcml`` file is
loaded.

You can define common configuration for your entire application in
``site.zcml``.  The content of ``src/tc/collector/configure.zcml``
will look like this::

  <configure
     xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
     xmlns:browser="http://namespaces.zope.org/browser"
     i18n_domain="ticketcollector">

    <include file="securitypolicy.zcml" />

    <!-- The following registration (defaultView) register 'index' as
         the default view for a container.  The name of default view
         can be changed to a different value, for example, 'index.html'.
         More details about defaultView registration is available here:
         http://bluebream.zope.org/doc/1.0/howto/defaultview.html
         -->

    <browser:defaultView
       for="zope.container.interfaces.IContainer"
       name="index"
       />

    <!-- To remove the sample application delete the following line
         and remove the `welcome` folder from this directory.
         -->
    <include package=".welcome" />

  </configure>

The file ``securitypolicy.zcml`` is where you can define your
security policies.  As you can see in ``configure.zcml``, it includes
``welcome``.  By default, if you include a package without mentioning
the configuration file, it will include ``configure.zcml``.

                          'zope.app.zcmlfiles',
                          ],
        entry_points = """
        [paste.app_factory]
        main = tc.main.startup:application_factory

        [paste.global_paster_command]
        shell = tc.main.debug:Shell
        """,
        )

Most of the details in ``setup.py`` are derived from user input when
creating the project from a template.  In the ``install_requires``
keyword argument, you can list all dependencies for the package.
There are two entry points, the first one is used by PasteDeploy to
find the WSGI application factory.  The second entry point registers
a sub-command for ``paster`` script named ``shell``.

Running Tests
-------------

BlueBream use `zope.testing
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.testing>`_ as the main framework
for automated testing.  Along with **zope.testing**, you can use
Python's ``unittest`` and ``doctest`` modules.  Also there is a
functional testing module called `zope.testbrowser
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.testbrowser>`_ . To set-up the test
cases, layers etc. BlueBream use the `z3c.testsetup
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.testsetup>`_ package.

BlueBream use the Buildout recipe called `zc.recipe.testrunner
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.recipe.testrunner>`_ to generate a
test runner script.

If you look at the buildout configuration, you can see the test
runner part::

  [test]
  recipe = zc.recipe.testrunner
  eggs = ticketcollector

The testrunner recipe creates a test runner using the
``zope.testing`` module.  The only mandatory option is ``eggs`` where
you can specify the eggs.

To run all test cases, use the ``bin/test`` command::

  jack@computer:/projects/ticketcollector$ bin/test

This command will find all the test cases and run them.

.. _tut1-app-object:

Creating the application object
-------------------------------

Container objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section we will explore one of the main concepts in
BlueBream: **container objects**.  As mentioned earlier BlueBream
uses an object database called ZODB to store your Python objects.
You can think of an object database as a container which contains
objects; the inner object may be another container which contains
other objects.

The object hierarchy may look like this::

  +-----------------------+
  |                       |
  |   +---------+  +--+   |
  |   |         |  +--+   |
  |   |  +--+   |         |
  |   |  +--+   |         |
  |   +---------+    +--+ |
  |                  +--+ |
  +-----------------------+

BlueBream will take care of the persistence of the objects.  In order
to make a custom object persistent the object class will have to
inherit from ``persistent.Persistent``.

Some classes in BlueBream that inherit from ``persistent.Persistent`` include:

- ``zope.container.btree.BTreeContainer``
- ``zope.container.folder.Folder``
- ``zope.site.folder.Folder``

When you inherit from any of these classes the instances of that
class will be persistent.  The second thing you need to do to make
objects persistent is to add the object to an existing container
object.  You can experiment with this from the debug shell provided
by BlueBream.  But before you try that out create a container class
somewhere in your code which can be imported later.  You can add this
definition to the ``src/tc/collector/__init__.py`` file (Delete it
after the experiment)::

  from zope.container.btree import BTreeContainer

  class MyContainer(BTreeContainer):
      pass

Then open the debug shell as given below::

  $ ./bin/paster shell debug.ini
  ...
  Welcome to the interactive debug prompt.
  The 'root' variable contains the ZODB root folder.
  The 'app' variable contains the Debugger, 'app.publish(path)' simulates a request.
  >>>

The name ``root`` refers to the top-level container in the database.
You can import your own container class, create an instance and add
it to the root folder::

  >>> from tc.main import MyContainer
  >>> root['c1'] = MyContainer()

ZODB is a transactional database so you will have to commit your
changes in order for them to be performed.  To commit your changes
use the function ``transaction.commit`` as described below::

  >>> import transaction
  >>> transaction.commit()

Now if you exit the debug prompt and open it again, you will see that you
can access the persistent object::

  $ ./bin/paster shell debug.ini
  ...
  Welcome to the interactive debug prompt.
  The 'root' variable contains the ZODB root folder.
  The 'app' variable contains the Debugger, 'app.publish(path)' simulates a request.
  >>> root['c1']
  <tc.main.MyContainer object at 0x96091ac>

Persisting random objects like this is not a particulary good idea.
The next section will explain how to create a formal schema for your
objects.  Now you can delete the object and remove the
``MyContainer`` class definition from
``src/tc/collector/__init__.py``.  You can delete the object like
this::

  >>> del(root['c1'])
  >>> import transaction
  >>> transaction.commit()

Declaring an Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   If you have never worked with ``zope.interface`` before, we
   recommend that you read through the :ref:`man-interface` chapter
   in the manual before proceding.

As the first step for creating the main application container object
which is going to hold all other objects, you need to create an
interface.  We will name the main application container interface
``ICollector``.  To make this interface describe a container object
have it inherit ``zope.container.interfaces.IContainer`` or any
interface derived from it.  It is recommended to add a site manager
inside the main application container.  In order to add a site
manager later, it is recommend to inherit from
``zope.site.interfaces.IFolder`` interface.  The ``IFolder`` inherits
from ``IContainer``.

Let's create a new Python package named ``collector`` inside
``src/tc``::

  $ mkdir src/tc/collector
  $ echo "# Python Package" > src/tc/collector/__init__.py

You can now create a file named ``src/tc/collector/interfaces.py`` to
add our interfaces::

  from zope.site.interfaces import IFolder
  from zope.schema import TextLine
  from zope.schema import Text

  class ICollector(IFolder):
      """The main application container"""

      name = TextLine(
          title=u"Name",
          description=u"Name of application container",
          default=u"",
          required=True)

      description = Text(
          title=u"Description",
          description=u"Description of application container",
          default=u"",
          required=False)

The interface defined here is your schema for the main application
object.  There are two fields defined in the schema.  The first one
is ``name`` and the second one is ``description``.  This schema can
later can be used to auto-generate web forms.

Implementing Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A schema can be described as a blueprint for your objects as it
defines the fields that the object must implement and the contracts
that it must fulfil.  Once written you can create some concrete
classes which implement your schema.

Next, you need to implement this interface.  To implement
``IContainer``, you can inherit from ``zope.site.folder.Folder``.
You can create the implementation in
``src/tc/collector/ticketcollector.py``::

  from zope.interface import implements
  from zope.site.folder import Folder

  from tc.collector.interfaces import ICollector

  class Collector(Folder):
      """A simple implementation of a collector using B-Tree
      Container."""

      implements(ICollector)

      name = u""
      description = u""

To declare that a class implements a particular interface you can use
the ``implements`` function from ``zope.interface``.

Registering components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the interfaces and their implementations are ready you can do
the configuration in ZCML.  Open the
``src/tc/collector/configure.zcml`` file for editing and enter the
following to declare ``ICollector`` a content component::

  <configure
     xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
     xmlns:browser="http://namespaces.zope.org/browser">

  <interface
     interface="tc.collector.interfaces.ICollector"
     type="zope.app.content.interfaces.IContentType"
     />

  </configure>

The ``zope.app.content.interfaces.IContentType`` represents a content
type.  If an **interface** provides the ``IContentType`` interface
type, then all objects providing the **interface** are considered to
be content objects.

To set annotations for collector objects we need to configure it as
implementing the ``zope.annotation.interfaces.IAttributeAnnotatable``
interface.  The example configuration below also declares that our
``Collector`` class implements
``zope.container.interfaces.IContentContainer``.  These two classes
are examples of marker interfaces, interfaces used to declare that a
particular object belongs to a special type without requiring the
presence of any attributes or methods.

In the same file (``src/tc/collector/configure.zcml``) before the
``</configure>`` add these lines::

  <class class="tc.collector.ticketcollector.Collector">
    <implements
       interface="zope.annotation.interfaces.IAttributeAnnotatable"
       />
    <implements
       interface="zope.container.interfaces.IContentContainer"
       />
    <require
       permission="zope.Public"
       interface="tc.collector.interfaces.ICollector"
       />
    <require
       permission="zope.Public"
       set_schema="tc.collector.interfaces.ICollector"
       />
  </class>

The ``class`` directive is a complex directive.  There are
subdirectives like ``implements`` and ``require`` below the ``class``
directive.  The ``class`` directive listed above also declares
permission settings for ``Collector``.

A view for adding collectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now the content component is ready to use but you will need a web
page which lets us add a ticket collector object.  You can use the
``zope.formlib`` package to create a form view.  You can add the view
class definition inside ``src/tc/collector/views.py`` like this::

  from zope.site import LocalSiteManager
  from zope.formlib import form

  from tc.collector.interfaces import ICollector

  from tc.collector.ticketcollector import Collector

  class AddTicketCollector(form.AddForm):

      form_fields = form.Fields(ICollector)

      def createAndAdd(self, data):
          name = data['name']
          description = data.get('description', u'')
          collector = Collector()
          collector.name = name
          collector.description = description
          self.context[name] = collector
          collector.setSiteManager(LocalSiteManager(collector))
          self.request.response.redirect(".")

The ``createAndAdd`` function will be called when the user presses
the *Add* button from the web form.  The second last line is very
important::

  collector.setSiteManager(LocalSiteManager(collector))

This line adds a site manager to the collector so that it can be used
as a persistent component registry to register local components like
local utilities.

As you have already seen in the previous chapter the ``browser:page``
directive is used for registering pages.  You can use the name
``add_ticket_collector`` and register it for
``zope.site.interfaces.IRootFolder``.  Add these lines to
``src/tc/collector/configure.zcml``::

  <browser:page
     for="zope.site.interfaces.IRootFolder"
     name="add_ticket_collector"
     permission="zope.Public"
     class="tc.collector.views.AddTicketCollector"
     />

The package development is complete now, but it is not yet included
from the main package.  To include this package in the main package
(``tc.main``) you need to modify the ``src/tc/main/configure.zcml``
and add this line before ``</configure>``::

  <include package="tc.collector" />

Now you can access the URL:
http://localhost:8080/@@add_ticket_collector .  It should display a
form where you can enter values for ``name`` and ``description``.
You can enter the ``name`` as ``mycollector``. After entering your
data, submit the form.

You can see that the file size of ``var/filestorage/Data.fs``
increases as objects are added.  ``Data.fs`` is where the persisted
objects are physically stored.

You can also confirm that the object is actually saved into the
database from the Python shell.  If you go to the Python shell and
try to access the root object you can see that it has the object you
added::

  jack@computer:/projects/ticketcollector$ ./bin/paster shell debug.ini
  ...
  Welcome to the interactive debug prompt.
  The 'root' variable contains the ZODB root folder.
  The 'app' variable contains the Debugger, 'app.publish(path)' simulates a request.
  >>> list(root.keys())
  [u'mycollector']

Through this debug shell you can introspect, add, update or delete
Python objects and attributes.

A default view for collector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you try to access the collector from the URL
http://localhost:8080/mycollector you will get a ``NotFound`` error
like this::

  URL: http://localhost:8080/mycollector
  ...
  NotFound: Object: <tc.collector.ticketcollector.Collector object at 0x9fe44ac>, name: u'@@index'

This error is raised because there is no view named ``index``
registered for ``ICollector``.  This section will show you how to
create a default view for the ``ICollector`` interface.

As you have already seen in the :ref:`started-getting` chapter, you
can create a simple view and register it from ZCML.

In ``src/tc/collector/views.py`` add a new view like this::

  class TicketCollectorMainView(form.DisplayForm):

      def __call__(self):
          return "Hello ticket collector!"

Then add the following in ``src/tc/collector/configure.zcml``::

  <browser:page
     for="tc.collector.interfaces.ICollector"
     name="index"
     permission="zope.Public"
     class="tc.collector.views.TicketCollectorMainView"
     />

Now you can visit: http://localhost:8080/mycollector It should
display a message like this::

  Hello ticket collector!

In the next section you will see more details about the main page for
collector.  We're also going to learn about Zope Page Templates.

.. _tut1-main-page:

Creating the main page
----------------------

Browser Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The browser page can be created using a page template.  The
``form.DisplayForm`` supports a ``template`` and ``form_fields``
attributes.  You can also remove the ``__call__`` method from
``TicketCollectorMainView``.  Update the ``TicketCollectorMainView``
class inside ``src/tc/collector/views.py`` like this::

  from zope.browserpage import ViewPageTemplateFile

  class TicketCollectorMainView(form.DisplayForm):

      form_fields = form.Fields(ICollector)

      template = ViewPageTemplateFile("collectormain.pt")


You can create ``src/tc/collector/collectormain.pt`` with the
following content::

  <html>
  <head>
  <title>Welcome to ticket collector!</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  Welcome to ticket collector!

  </body>
  </html>

Now you can visit: http://localhost:8080/mycollector .  It should
display "Welcome to ticket collector!".

Conclusions
-----------

This part of the tutorial covered the basics of creating a web
application using BlueBream.  We have described in detail how to use
the ``bluebream`` paster project template to create a new project. We
have discussed the process of building an application using
Buildout. We have created an application container. Finally, a
default view for the application container was created.
:ref:`tut2-tutorial` will expand the application with additional
functionality.
