Contributors
============

There are many people who contributed to BlueBream through the old
Zope 3 project from 2001.  In fact, many of the technologies came
from Zope 2 project which was started in 1998.  Thanks to all
contributors from 1998 for developing Zope.  It would be difficult to
list all the names here as we don't have enough details.  So, this is
a list of new contributors to documentation and bluebream package
from January, 2010.  This is a list of people who directly committed
to bluebream documentation and ``bluebream`` package.  But there are
many others who helped us through IRC, mailing list, wiki etc.
Thanks to all.  Please update this list, as soon as somebody is
committed to documentation directly.
