    used in production for more than a decade.

  Zope

    A `developer community`_ which has created many frameworks and
    Python libraries. The term Zope originally referred to
    :term:`Zope 2`.

  Zope Component Architecture
    `Zope Component Architecture`_ (ZCA) is a Python framework for
    supporting component based design and programming

  Distribute
    A `community developed fork`_ of the :term:`Setuptools` project.

  Zope Tool Kit
    The `Zope Tool Kit`_ (ZTK) is a set of libraries intended for

    server).

  Paste
    Paste_ is a tool for using a Web Server Gateway Interface stack

  PasteDeploy
    PasteDeploy_ provides code to load WSGI applications and servers
    from URIs; these URIs can refer to Python Eggs for INI-style
    configuration files. Paste Script provides commands to serve applications
    based on this configuration file.

  PasteScript
    PasteScript_ is a pluggable command-line frontend, including commands
    to setup package file layouts

  Separation of concerns
    `Separation of concerns`_ (SoC) is the process of separating a computer
    program into distinct features that overlap in functionality as
    little as possible.

  ZODB
    The `Zope Object Database`_ provides an object-oriented database
    for Python that provides a high-degree of transparency. Applications
    can take advantage of object database features with few, if any, changes
    to application logic. ZODB includes features such as a pluggable storage
    interface, rich transaction support, and undo.

  ZCML
    The `Zope Configuration Markup Language`_ is an XML configuration
    language used to populate the global component registry of an application
    that makes use of the Zope Component Architecture.

  Jim Fulton
    `James Fulton`_ - Chief Technology Officer, Zope Corp, AKA the
    *Zope Pope*, J1m in IRC.  He's the man.

  Bobo
    Jim Fulton's original design of object oriented internet

    for the impatient*.

  CGI
    `Common Gateway Interface`_

  Grok
    Grok_ is a web application framework for Python developers.
    It is aimed at both beginners and very experienced web developers.
    Grok has an emphasis on agile development. Grok is easy and powerful.

  mod_wsgi
    `Apache module`_ to host any Python application which supports
    the Python WSGI interface.  The module would be suitable for use
    in hosting high performance production web sites, as well as
