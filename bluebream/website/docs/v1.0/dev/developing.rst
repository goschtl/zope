Making BlueBream Releases
-------------------------

The release procedure followed by BlueBream is very similar to that
of ZTK `release guidelines
<http://docs.zope.org/zopetoolkit/process/releasing-software.html>`_.

Part of the `official release guidelines
<http://docs.zope.org/zopetoolkit/process/releasing-software.html>`_
is reviewing the changelog recorded in ``CHANGES.txt``.  This is an
important step that cannot be automated.

In other words, before starting a release make sure that:

1. All tests pass
2. All local changes are committed
3. The changelog is up to date.

Post release steps
------------------

1. Send announce to mailing list
2. Blog about it
3. Update twitter
