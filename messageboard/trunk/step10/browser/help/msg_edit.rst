  This screen allows you to edit the data (i.e. the subject and body) of
  the Message object.
  
  title - A one line unicode text string that briefly describes the
          purpose/subject of the message.
  
  body - A multiple line unicode text string that is the actual content of 
         the message. It is accepting HTML, but restricts the user to a 
         couple of selected tags. Feel free to type anything you wish.
