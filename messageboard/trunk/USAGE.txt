USAGE
=====

Each step package assumes that it is ``messageboard``. Therefore the best
thing to do is to download this entire package under ``messageboard`` and then
simply create a symbolic link::

  ln -s messageboard/stepX Zope3/src/messagboard

The highest step number should represent the most complete version. You then
simply hook up the application by adding a file called
``messageboard-configure.zcml`` to ``Zope3/package-includes``. The file should
contain a single line of the form::

  <include package="messageboard" />

For detailed installation and setup instructions see the Content Components
recipe at http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/DevelCookbook/NewContentObject.
