zdaemon Changelog
=================

After some unknown release(???)
-------------------------------

 - Made 'zdaemon.zdoptions' not fail for --help when __main__.__doc__
   is None.

After zdaemon 1.1
-----------------

 - Updated test 'testRunIgnoresParentSignals':
  
  o Use 'mkdtemp' to create a temporary directory to hold the test socket
    rather than creating the test socket in the test directory.
    Hopefully this will be more robust.  Sometimes the test directory
    has a path so long that the test socket can't be created.
  
  o Changed management of 'donothing.sh'.  This script is now created by
    the test in the temporarary directory with the necessary
    permissions. This is to avoids possible mangling of permissions
    leading to spurious test failures.  It also avoids management of a
    file in the source tree, which is a bonus.

 - Rearranged source tree to conform to more usual zpkg-based layout:
   
   o Python package lives under 'src'.

   o Dependencies added to 'src' as 'svn:externals'.

   o Unit tests can now be run from a checkout.

 - Made umask-based test failures due to running as root emit a more
   forceful warning.

zdaemon 1.1 (2005/06/09)
------------------------

 - SVN tag:  svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zdaemon/tags/zdaemon-1.1

 - Tagged to make better 'svn:externals' linkage possible.
