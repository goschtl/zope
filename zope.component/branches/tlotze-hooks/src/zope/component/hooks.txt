==============================
The current component registry
==============================

There can be any number of component registries in an application. One of them
is the global component registry, and there is also the concept of a currently
used component registry. Component registries other than the global one are
associated with objects called sites. The ``zope.component.hooks`` module
provides an API to set and access the current site as well as manipulate the
adapter hook associated with it.

As long as we haven't set a site, none is being considered current:

>>> from zope.component.hooks import getSite
>>> print getSite()
None

We can also ask for the current component registry (aka site manager
historically); it will return the global one if no current site is set:

>>> from zope.component.hooks import getSiteManager
>>> getSiteManager()
<BaseGlobalComponents base>
