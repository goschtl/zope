TODO:


- Tests for zope.component-Stacking
  Registry-Object: new registration, delete, view old, bases chain
  getGlobalSiteManager()
  getSiteManager / setSite

    - Do we need to make cache contents (in AdapterRegistry/Lookup) stackable?
      aka, do list-like lookup results work or are they broken by push/pop?
      Example-test:
      register subscriber
      A = subscribers
      push
      register some more subscribers
      B = subscribers
      pop
      C = subscribers
      assert C == A
      assert len(B) > len(C)

    - Do we have to make _v_subregistries stackable?


- zope.interface uses C-code for some parts. Is it a performance problem that
  'stackable' is Python-code? (This should only apply to tests, since we're
  going to want to create a way to bypass the stackable stuff)

* Stackable:
- Needs a better name
- Create separate egg?

- don't create a new class object for each stackable() call
- prettier class name, repr, etc.

- have a name or "stack context", so you can say push('zope.component')
- do we leak memory since we never unregister stackables?
