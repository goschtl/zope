TODO:


- Tests for zope.component-Stacking
  Registry-Object: new registration, delete, view old, bases chain
  getGlobalSiteManager()
  getSiteManager / setSite

    - stackable.reset() needs to take into account "dying" stackables

    - Do we have to make _v_subregistries stackable?


- zope.interface uses C-code for some parts. Is it a performance problem that
  'stackable' is Python-code? (This should only apply to tests, since we're
  going to want to create a way to bypass the stackable stuff)

* Stackable:
- Needs a better name
- Create separate egg?

- don't create a new class object for each stackable() call
- prettier class name, repr, etc.

- have a name or "stack context", so you can say push('zope.component')
- do we leak memory since we never unregister stackables?
