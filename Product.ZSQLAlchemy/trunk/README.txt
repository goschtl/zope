What is it:

    - ZSQLAlchemy tries to provide a basic SQLAlchemy infrastructure to be used
      with Zope applications. It basically acts like some kind of DA and cares
      automatically about connection and transaction handling

Limitation:

    - currently only supports Postgres through the psycopg2 Python bindings
      for Postgres



Requirements:

    - Zope 2.8

    - sqlalchemy V 0.3.0 or higher

    - psycopg2 2.0.5
