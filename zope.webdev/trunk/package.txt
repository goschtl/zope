===========
The Package
===========

The package is the WebDev version of a traditional Python package. It is very
similar to a site-management folder that manages the package's "code".

  >>> from zope.webdev import package

Every package has a name that must be a Python identifier. While the name does
not have to be set during initialization, it is very important to specify it
always:

  >>> person = package.Package('person')
  >>> person
  <Package 'person'>

  >>> person.name
  'person'

Note: The reason it is not required is because of the Web interface. There the
name is assigned when the package is added to the container.

Additionally, the package supports a docstring, version, license and author
field.

  >>> person.docstring
  >>> person.docstring = u'A package for defining and managing people.'
  >>> person.docstring
  u'A package for defining and managing people.'

  >>> person.version
  >>> person.version = u'0.1'
  >>> person.version
  u'0.1'

  >>> person.license
  >>> person.license = u'ZPL 2.1'
  >>> person.license
  u'ZPL 2.1'

  >>> person.author
  >>> person.author = u'Stephan Richter'
  >>> person.author
  u'Stephan Richter'

Of course, all those parameters can also be passed into the constructor:

  >>> pp = package.Package('person', u'A people package',
  ...                      u'0.1', u'ZPL 2.1', u'Stephan Richter')

  >>> pp.name
  'person'
  >>> pp.docstring
  u'A people package'
  >>> pp.version
  u'0.1'
  >>> pp.license
  u'ZPL 2.1'
  >>> pp.author
  u'Stephan Richter'

Also note that the ``name`` attribute is read-only.

  >>> pp.name = 'newperson'
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AttributeError: can't set attribute

This is because the naming of the package should only be controlled by the
container, in this case the site manager. The site manager sets the
``__name__`` attribute,

  >>> pp.__name__ = 'newperson'

which sets the name:

  >>> pp.name
  'newperson'

Now, a package is not really a site-management folder, but just another
component implementing ``IRegisterableContainer``. Let's make sure the at
interface is provided,

  >>> from zope.app.component import interfaces
  >>> interfaces.registration.IRegisterableContainer.providedBy(person)
  True

and that the package provides the registration manager:

  >>> person.registrationManager
  <zope.app.component.registration.RegistrationManager ...>
