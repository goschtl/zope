You are invited to become a Zope Foundation Committer member.  Zope
Foundation Committer members can vote for Zope Foundation board
members and will have access to the future Zope Foundation Software
Repository.

You are receiving this message because you checked into the Zope
software repository between January 1, 2005 and May 11, 2006.

To become a committer member, you need to fill out the membership
agreement at:

  http://www.zope.org/DevHome/Foundation/ZopeFoundationMembershipAgreement.pdf

and the committer agreement at:

  http://www.zope.org/DevHome/Foundation/ZopeFoundation_Committer_Agreement.pdf

Note that you and your employer, if any, need to fill out the
committer agreement.  If you are self- or un-employed, then write
"self employed" or "non applicable" into the employer block on page 3
of the committer agreement. Don't leave the employer block blank.
 
If you wish, you can send just pages 1 and 9 of the membership agreement.

You can submit the agreements in one of 3 ways:

  - Send the signed agreements to the address indicated on the
    contributor agreement.  (I don't recommend this option if you are
    outside of the U.S.)

  - Fax them to +1 703 995 0412.

  - Email the scanned agreements to legal@zope.org.

An email acknowledging receipt of the agreements will be sent so that
you can know whether we have received it.

If you decide to become a committer member, you should also subscribe
to the Zope Foundation mailing list:

  http://mail.zope.org/mailman/listinfo/foundation

You will also be subscribed by the foundation-committers list.

I encourage you to become a member as soon as you can.  We hope to
elect the first Zope Foundation Board by the end of June and expect to
begin the committer-member voting process by mid-June.

Questions that are specific to you should be sent to legal@zope.org.

General Questions about the Zope Foundation or about the process of
becoming a committer member should be sent to the Zope-Foundation
mailing list:

  http://mail.zope.org/mailman/listinfo/foundation

Note that you must subscribe to this list to send to it though.

Jim
