You are invited to become a Zope Foundation Committer member.  Zope
Foundation Committer members can vote for Zope Foundation board
members and will have access to the future Zope Foundation Software
Repository.

You are receiving this message because you checked into the Zope
software repository between January 1, 2005 and May 11, 2006.

To become a member, you need to fill out the committer agreement at:

  http://www.zope.org/DevHome/Foundation/ZopeFoundation_Committer_Agreement.pdf

Note that you and your employer, if any, need to fill this out. 
You can submit it in one of 3 ways:

  - Send the signed agreement to the address indicated on the agreement.
    (I don't recommend this option if you are outside of the U.S.)

  - Fax it to the number shown the agreement.

  - Email the scanned agreement to legal@zope.org.

An email acknowledging receipt of the agreement will be sent so that
you can know whether we have received it.

If you decide to become a committer member, you should also subscribe
to the Zope Foundation mailing list:

  http://mail.zope.org/mailman/listinfo/foundation

I encourage you to become a member as soon as you can.  We hope to
elect the first Zope Foundation Board by July 1 and expect to begin the
committer-member voting process by mid-June.

Questions that are specific to you should be sent to legal@zope.org.

General Questions about the Zope Foundation or about the process of
becoming a committer member should be send to the Zope-Foundation
mailing list:

  http://mail.zope.org/mailman/listinfo/foundation

Note that you must subscribe to this list to send to it though.

Jim
