You are invited to become a Zope Foundation Committer.  Zope
Foundation Committers can vote for Zope Foundation board members and
will have access to the future Zope Foundation Software Repository.

You are receiving this message because you checked into the Zope
software repository between January 1, 2005 and May 11, 2006.

To become a member, you need to fill out the committer agreement at:

  http://www.zope.org/DevHome/Foundation/ZopeFoundation_Committer_Agreement.pdf

Note that you and your employer, if any, need to fill this out. 
You can submit it in one of 3 ways:

  - Send the signed agreement to the address indicated on the agreement.
    (I don't recommend this option if you are outside of the U.S.)

  - Fax it to the number shown the agreement.

  - Email the scanned agreement to the email address shown on the
    agreement, legal@zope.org.

An email acknowledging receipt of the agreement will be sent so that
you can know whether we have received it.

Let me know if you have any questions that are specific to you.
General Questions about the Zope Foundation or about the process of
becoming a committer member should be send to the Zope-Foundation
mailing list:

  http://mail.zope.org/mailman/listinfo/foundation

Note that you must subscribe to this list to send to it though.
