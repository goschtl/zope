             annual at-large elections by the Committer Members using

             each person entitled to vote, as applicable, shall be
             entitled to cast numbered preference votes for as many
             candidates as there are open positions allocated by such

             and votes for candidates who do not receive enough votes
             to be elected are transferred in accordance with the
             preferences of each voter. The Executive Director (as
             described in Article V below) and the Zope Management
             Organization (as described in Article VII below) shall be

             one (1) Solution Provider Director. The Solution Provider
             Director(s) shall represent the entire Solution Provider
             class of Members. Only Solution Providers are eligible to
             serve as Solution Provider Directors. Solution Provider

   3.4. Zope Corporation: Zope Corporation (or its successors or
        assigns) shall be entitled to appoint one (1) Director in
        addition to any appointments or elections to which it might be
        entitled by virtue of other Foundation participation (e.g.,
        Strategic Developer Membership). Zope Corporation (or its
        successor or assigns) may, in its sole discretion,
        irreversibly surrender this right at any time by giving
        written notice to the Zope Foundation.

   3.5. A director shall be deemed to be in Good Standing, and thus
        eligible to vote on issues coming before the Board, if the
        director has attended (in person or telephonically) a minimum
        of three (3) of the last four (4) Board meetings (if there
        have been at least four meetings), unless such absence has
        been approved by the Chairman of the Board (as defined in
        Section 5.3.1), in his or her reasonable discretion. Strategic
        Developer Members and Strategic Consumer Members may replace
        their representative on the Board at any time by providing
        written notice to the Secretary of the Zope Foundation, as
        defined in Section 5.3.3 (the “Secretary”). In the event a
        Board member is unavailable to attend or participate in a
        meeting of the Board, he or she may send a representative and
        may vote by proxy, which shall be included in determining
        whether the director is in Good Standing. A director shall be
        immediately removed from the Board upon the termination of the
        membership of such director’s Member organization in
        accordance with Section 6.17.

   3.6. All directors shall hold office until their respective
        successors are appointed or elected, as applicable. There
        shall be no prohibition on re-election or redesignation of any
        director following the completion of that director’s term of
        office.

      3.6.1. Strategic Developer; Consumer Directors. Strategic
             Developer Directors and Strategic Consumer Directors
             shall serve in such capacity until the earlier of their
             removal by their respective appointing Member
             organization or as otherwise provided for in these
             Bylaws.

      3.6.2. Solution Provider Directors; Committer Directors;
             Associate Director. Solution Provider Directors,
             Committer Directors, and the Associate Director shall
             each serve one-year terms and shall be elected to serve
             until the next annual meeting and until their respective
             successors are elected and qualified, or as otherwise
             provided for in these Bylaws. Procedures governing
             elections of Solution Provider Directors, Committer
             Directors, and the Associate Director may be established
             pursuant to resolutions of the Board provided that such
             resolutions are not inconsistent with any provision of
             these Bylaws or the Certificate of Incorporation of the
             Zope Foundation.

   3.7. All meetings of the Board may be held at any place within or
        without the State of Delaware that has been designated from
        time to time by resolution of the Board or by the written
        notice of the Chairman of the Board, as defined in 5.3.1.

   3.8. The Chairman will schedule regular and (as applicable) special
        meetings of the Board. No Board meeting will be deemed to have
        been validly held unless the Chairman provided notice of same
        to each of the directors at least thirty (30) calendar days
        prior to such meeting, which notice will identify all
        potential actions to be undertaken by the Board at the Board
        meeting. Each Director may waive the notice requirements of
        this paragraph with written notice to the Chairman in advance
        of the meeting. No director will be intentionally excluded
        from Board meetings and all directors shall receive notice of
        the meeting as specified above; however, Board meetings need
        not be delayed or rescheduled merely because one or more of
        the directors cannot attend or participate so long as at least
        a quorum of the Board (as defined in Section 3.11) is
        represented at the Board meeting. Electronic voting shall be
        permitted in conjunction with any and all meetings of the
        Board (including Special Meetings as set forth in 3.9 below)
        the subject matter of which requires a vote of the Board to be
        delayed until each such director in attendance thereat has
        conferred with his or her respective Member organization as
        set forth in Section 3.12.2.1.

   3.9. Special meetings of the Board for any purpose or purposes may
        be called at any time by the Chairman or by fifty percent
        (50%) or more of the directors then in Good Standing and
        notice of such special meeting shall be given to all of the
        directors in accordance with Section 3.8 above.

   3.10. Action by the Board. No action may be taken or approved by the
         Board that is outside the stated purpose of the Zope
         Foundation as set forth in Section 1. Except as provided
         herein, the Board may undertake an action only if it was
         identified by the Chairman in a Board Meeting notice or
         otherwise identified in a notice of special meeting and
         approved by the requisite number of directors as described
         below:

                   votes in connection with a meeting of the Board at
                   which a quorum was present, the requisite number of
                   votes that would have been required at such meeting
                   to pass an action shall be required to pass an
                   action via this electronic voting provision. Only
                   those directors in attendance of the meeting shall
                   be permitted to vote with respect to this Section
                   3.12.2.1. The deadline for receipt of electronic
                   votes with respect to any such vote shall be no
                   sooner than two (2) weeks from the date of the

         3.12.2.2. Action Without Meeting. For purposes of taking
                   action without a meeting, solicitation via
                   electronic balloting and voting shall be permitted
                   hereunder. Such procedure shall be initiated by the
                   electronic distribution of ballots and all related
                   materials for consideration by the Board to all of
                   the directors in Good Standing at the time of such
                   distribution. Thereafter, such directors shall be
                   permitted to cast their votes electronically in
                   response to the distributed ballots. The deadline
                   for receipt of such electronic votes cast by the
                   directors shall be no less than two (2) weeks from
                   the date of mailing of the balloting materials, as
                   set forth therein. The foregoing notwithstanding,

                   is solicited may, by unanimous vote during the
                   meeting, reduce the minimum time for the return of
                   ballots.

   3.13. Reimbursement. Directors and members of Board Committees (as defined
         in Section 4.2) may receive such reimbursement for expenses as may be
         fixed or determined by resolution of the Board; provided that, such
         reimbursement for expenses shall be reasonable and shall be comparable
         to reimbursements paid by unaffiliated entities for a like expense.

   3.14. Standard of Conduct. A director shall discharge the duties of
         a director, including duties as a member of any Board
         Committee upon which the director may serve, in good faith,
         with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position
         would exercise under similar circumstances. In discharging
         the duties of a director, a director shall be entitled to
         rely on information, opinions, reports or statements,
         including financial statements and other financial data, in
         each case if prepared or presented by: (a) one or more
         officers or employees of the Zope Foundation whom the
         director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in
         the matters presented; (b) legal counsel, public accountants
         or other persons as to matters the director reasonably
         believes are within the person’s professional or expert
         competence; or (c) a Board Committee as to matters within the
         Board Committee’s jurisdiction, if the director reasonably
         believes the Board Committee merits confidence. A director is
         not acting in good faith if the director has knowledge
         concerning the matter in question that makes reliance
         otherwise permitted in this Section 3.14 unwarranted.

   3.15. Resignation and Removal.

      3.15.1. Resignation. Any director may resign at any time by
              giving written notice to the Board or the Executive
              Director and the acceptance of the resignation shall not
              be necessary to make it effective. A resignation is
              effective upon the date provided for in the notice. If
              no effective date is provided in the notice the
              resignation shall be effective as of its receipt by the
              Board or Executive Director. Once delivered, a notice of
              resignation is irrevocable unless permitted to be
              withdrawn by the Board prior to its effectiveness.

      3.15.2. Removal for Cause. Any director may be removed “For
              Cause” at a meeting called for that purpose. For the
              purposes of this Section 3.15.2, “For Cause” shall mean
              when any director has been (i) declared of unsound mind
              by a final order of court, (ii) convicted of a felony,
              or (iii) found by the Board to have breached any duty
              arising under these Bylaws or the Certificate of
              Incorporation of the Zope Foundation. Such director may
              only be removed “For Cause” after the affirmative vote
              of a simple majority of the directors in Good Standing
              (exclusive of the director facing removal) represented
              at a Board meeting at which a quorum is present.

      3.15.3. Removal without Cause. Any Solution Provider Director,
              Associate Director or Committer Director, as applicable,
              may be removed without cause at a special meeting called
              for that purpose by the members of the class that
              appointed such director. Such director(s) may be removed
              hereunder only by the affirmative vote of two-thirds
              (2/3) of the members of the class that appointed such
              director represented at a special meeting at which a
              quorum is present. Strategic Developer Directors and
              Strategic Consumer Directors may only be removed without
              cause by their respective appointer Member
              organizations. Such a removal of Strategic Developer
              Directors and Strategic Consumer Directors do not
              require the approval of the Board.

      3.15.4. Removal for Dues Delinquent. With respect to Strategic
              Developer Directors and Strategic Consumer Directors, in
              the event the Member appointing such director is in
              Default or Dues Delinquent (as set forth in Section 6.16
              hereof), such director shall be removed from the Board,
              without further action by the Board or the Membership
              At-Large.

      3.15.5. Vacancies. A vacancy or vacancies shall be deemed to
              exist (i) in the case of the death or the resignation or
              removal of any director (ii) if the authorized number of
              directors is increased without election or appointment,
              as applicable, of the additional directors so provided
              for; or (iii) in the case of failure at any time to
              elect or appoint, as applicable, the full number of
              authorized directors. Any vacancy of a Board seat
              appointed by a Strategic Developer Member or Strategic
              Consumer Member shall be filled within three (3) weeks
              of the vacancy by the Member whose Board seat has been
              vacated. A vacancy of a Board seat held by a Committer
              Director, Solution Provider Director, or the Associate
              Director shall be filled by the Board appointing a
              director from nominees proffered by the members of such
              class until the next annual election as specified in
              Section 3.3.2, 3.3.4, and 3.3.5. In no event shall the
              failure of any Member or class of members to elect or
              appoint, as applicable, a new director to such vacant
              Board seat prohibit the Board from meeting and

             of the Corporation. If required by the Board, the
             Treasurer shall give the Corporation a bond for such term

             developments within the Zope Foundation (“Update
             Reports”). In addition to any material development
             updates, the Executive Director shall issue general
             reports on the status of the Zope Foundation on a
             semi-annual basis (“Semi-Annual Reports”). Such
             Semi-Annual Reports shall include: (i) status reports on
             development projects, (ii) financial information reports,
             (iii) membership information reports; and (iv) any other
             material information for such period with respect to the
             Zope Foundation. 

      5.3.7. Standards of Conduct for Officers. An officer shall
             discharge the officer’s duties, in good faith, with the
             care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position
             would exercise under similar circumstances, and in a
             manner the officer reasonably believes to be in the best
             interests of the Zope Foundation. In discharging the
             duties of an officer, an officer shall be entitled to
             rely on information, opinions, reports or statements,
             including financial statements and other financial data,
             in each case if prepared or presented by: (a) one or more
             officers or employees of the Zope Foundation whom the
             officer reasonably believes to be reliable and competent
             in the matters presented; or (b) legal counsel, public
             accountants or other persons as to matters the officer
             reasonably believes are within the person’s professional
             or expert competence. An officer is not acting in good
             faith if the officer has knowledge concerning the matter
             in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted in
             this Section 5.3.7 unwarranted. An officer is not liable
             to the Zope Foundation, any Member or any other person
             for any action taken or not taken as an officer, if the
             officer acted in compliance with this Section 5.3.7. 

6. Membership at-Large.

        Members; (ii) Strategic Consumer Members; (iii) Committer
        Members; (iv) Solution Provider Members; and (v) Associate
        Members. As used herein, the term “Member” shall be used to
        refer generically to a “Strategic Developer Member,”
        “Strategic Consumer Member,” “Committer Member,” “Solution
        Provider Member” or an “Associate Member” as applicable. All
        five classes of membership shall be collectively referred to
        as the “Membership At-Large.”

   6.2. Membership Qualifications. In general, members are expected to
        adhere to the following criteria: (i) express public support
        for the Zope Foundation and the Zope Platform; (ii) except for
        Strategic Consumer Members, Associate Members and Committer
        Members, make available a commercial Zope-based product or
        service offering within twelve (12) months of joining the Zope
        Foundation or use the Zope Platform in the development of a
        commercial offering within twelve (12) months of joining the
        Zope Foundation; and (iii) sign the Zope Foundation Membership
        Agreement and abide by its terms. Multiple “Affiliates” of an
        entity shall constitute one (1) Member only, regardless of
        membership class. For purposes of these Bylaws, “Affiliate”
        means any entity that is directly or indirectly controlled by,
        under common control with or that controls the subject party,
        and “control” means direct or indirect ownership of or the
        right to exercise (i) greater than fifty percent (50%) of the
        outstanding shares or securities entitled to vote for the
        election of directors or similar managing authority of the
        subject entity; or (ii) greater than fifty percent (50%) of
        the ownership interest representing the right to make the
        decisions for the subject entity. The following shall be the
        requirements for membership in each given membership class:

             in the aggregate hold more than two-thirds (2/3) of the
             seats on the Board or adding another Strategic Developer

        resolution establish such additional rights, privileges and
        duties corresponding to any class of members; provided that,
        such rights, privileges or duties are not inconsistent with
        the Bylaws. 

   6.4. Fees, Dues and Assessment.

      6.4.1. Funding. Each Member will pay dues as set forth in the

        approving or amending the Membership Agreement, or (iii)

        the Zope Foundation; such action must be approved by
        two-thirds (2/3) of the Membership At-Large represented at a
        meeting in which a quorum is present.

   6.6. Place of Meetings. All meetings of the Membership At-Large
        shall be held either at the principal office of the Zope
        Foundation or at any other place within or without the State

   6.7. Meetings Generally. The annual meetings of the Membership
        At-Large shall be held in the first calendar quarter of each
        year, on such date and at such time and place as determined by
        the Board (“Annual Meetings”). Any Member shall be permitted
        to participate in any and all meetings of the Membership
        At-Large (including Special Meetings as set forth in Section
        6.8) by, or conduct the eeting through, use of any means of
        communication (including telephonic communication) by which
        all members participating may simultaneously hear each other
        during the meeting. A Member participating in a meeting by
        this means is deemed to be present in person at the
        meeting. Electronic voting may be used in conjunction with any
        and all meetings of the members (including Special Meetings as
        set forth in Section 6.8) the subject matter of which requires
        a vote to be delayed until each such Member in attendance
        thereat has conferred with his or her respective Member
        organization as set forth in Section 6.12.1 below.

   6.8. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Membership At-Large
        shall be held at the call of the Chairman of the Board or by a
        number of the members which in the aggregate represent at
        least twenty percent (20%) or more of the Membership At-Large
        of the Zope Foundation by a written demand signed, dated, and
        delivered to the Secretary. Notice of a special meeting shall
        be given within thirty (30) days following the date the
        written demand is delivered to the Secretary, in accordance
        with Section 6.9 below.

   6.9. Notice of Meetings. Notice of each annual and special meeting
        of the Membership At-Large shall be given to each Member at
        the last address of record, by electronic mail at least thirty
        (30) days before the meeting, or by means other than first
        class mail at least forty-five (45) days but not more than
        sixty (60) days before the meeting. The notice shall include
        the date, time, and place of the meeting or the date on which
        any ballot enclosed therewith shall be required to be returned

        of each annual and special meeting shall include a description
        of any matter or matters that must be approved by the
        Membership At-Large pursuant to these Bylaws or applicable
        law. In the case of special meetings, the notice shall specify
        the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Such
        notice shall be given in writing to every Member who, on the
        record date for notice of the meeting, is entitled to vote
        thereat.

   6.10. Adjourned Meetings. Any Membership At-Large meeting, annual
         or special, whether or not a quorum is present, may be
         adjourned by the vote of a majority of the Membership
         At-Large either present in person or represented by proxy. It
         shall not be necessary to give any such notice of the time
         and place of the adjourned meeting or of the business to be
         transacted thereat, other than by an announcement at the
         meeting at which such adjournment is taken. If after the
         adjournment a new record date is fixed for notice or voting,
         a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
         Member who, on the record date for notice of the meeting, is
         entitled to vote at the meeting. 

   6.11. Quorum. Unless otherwise provided herein, the presence in
         person or by proxy of at least a simple majority of the
         Membership At-Large shall constitute a quorum for the
         transaction of business. For purposes of calculating the
         quorum requirements set forth in this Section 6.11, Committer
         Members who are employed by the same organization (including
         Affiliates) shall collectively be considered one (1) Member.

   6.12. Voting; Electronic Voting.

      6.12.1. General. Each Member is entitled to one (1) vote on each
              matter submitted to a vote of the Membership At-Large.

              connection with both meetings of the Members and the
              solicitation of written consents as follows:

         6.12.2.1. Meetings. For purposes of electronic votes
                   solicited in connection with a meeting of the
                   Membership At-Large at which a quorum was present,
                   the requisite number of votes that would have been
                   required at such meeting to pass an action shall be
                   required to pass an action via this electronic
                   voting provision. Only those Members in attendance
                   of the meeting shall be permitted to vote with
                   respect to this Section 6.12.2.1. The deadline for
                   receipt of electronic votes with respect to any
                   such vote shall be no sooner than two (2) weeks
                   from the date of the meeting, as announced prior to
                   adjournment of such meeting.


         6.12.2.2. Action Without Meeting. For purposes of taking
                   action without a meeting solicitation via
                   electronic balloting and voting shall be permitted
                   hereunder. Such procedure shall be initiated by the
                   electronic distribution of ballots and all related
                   materials for consideration by the Membership
                   At-Large to all of the Members at the time of such
                   distribution. Thereafter, the Members shall be
                   permitted to cast their votes electronically in
                   response to the distributed ballots. The deadline
                   for receipt of such electronic votes cast by the
                   Members shall be no less than two (2) weeks from
                   the date of the meeting, as set forth in the
                   balloting materials.

   6.13. Action Without Meeting. Any action required or permitted to
         be taken by the Membership At-Large at a meeting may be taken
         without a meeting if a majority of all of the Members shall
         consent in writing to such action (subject to the
         super-majority provision set forth in 6.5, in which case a
         super-majority of all of the Members shall be required). The
         action shall be evidenced by one or more written consents
         describing the action to be taken, signed by each Member, and
         included in the minutes or filed with the corporate records
         reflecting the action taken. Any action taken hereunder shall
         be effective upon the receipt of the written consent of the
         requisite number of Members for approval of the action under
         consideration. Electronic voting shall be permitted in
         conjunction with the solicitation of written consents as set
         forth in Section 6.12.2.2 above.

   6.14. Conduct of Meetings. Meetings of the Membership At-Large
         shall be presided over by the Executive Director, or in the
         absence of the Executive Director, by the chair appointed by
         the Executive Director. The Secretary shall act as the
         secretary of all meetings of the Membership At-Large,
         provided that, in his or her absence the presiding officer
         shall appoint another Member to act as Acting Secretary of
         the meeting.

   6.15. Delinquency; Non-Payment of Dues. In the event that a Member
         does not pay its annual membership dues and all compounded
         late fees within thirty (30) days of the invoice due date
         (“Dues Delinquent”), the membership of such Member shall,
         without further action by the Board or the Membership
         At-Large, be terminated. 

   6.16. Termination of Membership. The membership of any Member shall
         terminate upon the occurrence of any one or more of the
         following:

      6.16.1. Resignation. Any Member may resign from the Zope
              Foundation in writing filed with the Secretary. The
              resignation of a Member shall not relieve the Member
              from any payment obligations the Member may have to the
              Zope Foundation as a result of obligations incurred or
              commitments made prior to resignation. Except as
              otherwise set forth in these Bylaws, a resigning Member
              shall not be entitled to receive any refund, pro rata or
              otherwise, of any membership fee, dues or assessments
              for the balance of the calendar year in which the
              resignation is effective. Within ten (10) days of
              resigning from the Zope Foundation, a Member may appeal
              in writing to the Board for a pro rata refund of its
              annual membership dues. The appeal will specifically set
              forth any circumstances that the Member believes justify
              a refund in its case. The Board shall decide by simple
              majority upon the appeal in its sole discretion at its
              first meeting following the appeal scheduled under
              Section 3.8. 

      6.16.2. Expulsion, Termination or Suspension. The membership of
              any Member may be terminated “For Cause” upon the
              affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the members of
              the Board in good standing after a hearing duly held in
              accordance with this Section 6.17.2. As used in this
              Section 6.17.2, two-thirds (2/3) vote means two-thirds
              (2/3) of the members of the Board exclusive of such
              Member’s director on the Board for Strategic Developer
              or Strategic Consumer Members, and exclusive of a
              Solution Provider Board Director or Associate Director
              only if the director is also a representative of the
              Member facing expulsion or suspension (any such
              director, an “Affected Director”). For purposes of this
              Section 6.17.2 “For Cause” shall mean the Member has
              materially breached the Membership Agreement, Bylaws, IP
              Policy, ZPL and/or other related Zope Foundation
              agreements or policies, and has not cured such breach
              within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice
              from the Zope Foundation. Such determination shall be
              made in the sole and absolute discretion of the Board
              (excluding the Affected Director). Following the
              determination by the Board that a Member should be
              terminated the following procedures shall apply:

         6.16.2.1. A notice shall be sent by mail by prepaid,
                   first-class or certified mail to the most recent
                   address of such Member as shown on the Zope
                   Foundation’s records, setting forth the termination
                   and the reasons therefore. Such notice shall be
                   sent at least fifteen (15) days before the proposed
                   effective date of the termination.

         6.16.2.2. The Member being terminated shall be given an
                   opportunity to be heard, either orally or in
                   writing, at a hearing to be held no fewer than five
                   (5) days before the effective date of the proposed
                   termination. The hearing shall be held by the
                   Board. The notice to the Member of its proposed
                   termination shall state that such Member is
                   entitled, upon request, to such hearing, shall
                   state that a date, time and place of the hearing
                   will be established upon receipt of request
                   therefore, and shall state, that in the absence of
                   such request, the effective date of the proposed
                   termination.

         6.16.2.3. In the event that a hearing is held, then following
                   such hearing the Board (excluding the Affected
                   Director) shall decide whether such Member should
                   in fact be terminated, or sanctioned via written
                   reprimand as determined by the Board; provided
                   that, any such decision to terminate or sanction
                   such Member must be approved by a vote of
                   two-thirds (2/3) of the Board in good standing
                   (excluding the Affected Director). The decision of
                   the Board shall be final.

         6.16.2.4. Any action challenging a termination of membership
                   of a Member, including any claim alleging defective
                   notice, must be commenced within fifteen (15) days
                   after the date of the termination. 

   6.17. Reinstatement. Members terminated pursuant to Section 6.17.2
         may only be reinstated upon the affirmative vote of at least
         two-thirds (2/3) of the directors in Good Standing
         represented at a Board meeting at which a quorum is present.

   6.18. Nonliability. No Member shall be liable for the debts,
         liabilities, or obligations of the Zope Foundation merely by
         reason of being a Member.

   6.19. Assignment. Upon the completion of any acquisition or merger
         involving a Member in which the Member is not the surviving
         entity, the Board, in its sole discretion, may permit such
         Member's membership to be transferred to the surviving
         entity.

8. Committees of the Membership-At-Large.

   8.1. The Membership At-Large may establish such committees as it
        deems necessary or appropriate to conduct the business and
        further the objectives of the Zope Foundation (each, a
        “Membership At-Large Committee”). The establishment by the
        Membership At-Large of any Membership At-Large Committee is
        subject to confirmation by a simple majority of the Membership
        At-Large represented at a meeting in which a quorum is
        present. The composition of any such committees and the
        powers, duties and responsibilities delegated thereto, on
        behalf of the Membership At-Large, shall be determined by the
        Chairman subject to the foregoing Member approval.


9. Advisory Board.

   9.1. The Board may, by resolution, establish a Board of Advisors
        (the “Advisory Board”) to be comprised of one or more
        individuals chosen by the Board at its sole discretion. The
        Board shall not be bound by any advice or decision of the
        Advisory Board. The members of the Advisory Board shall not
        have the rights or privileges of directors or the Membership
        At-Large of the Zope Foundation and shall have no power or
        authority over the operation of the Zope Foundation. A member
        of the Advisory Board may be removed at any time by the
        affirmative vote of a majority of the Board with or without
        cause.


10. Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Agents.

   10.1. Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Agents. The Zope
         Foundation shall indemnify any person made or threatened to
         be made a party to an action by or in the right of the Zope
         Foundation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of
         the fact that he, his testator or intestate is or was a
         director or officer of the Zope Foundation, against amounts
         paid in settlement and reasonable expenses, including
         attorneys’ fees actually and necessarily incurred by him in
         connection with the defense or settlement of such action or
         in connection with an appeal therein, except in relation to
         matters as to which such person is adjudged to have breached
         his duty to the Zope Foundation. The Zope Foundation shall
         indemnify any person, made, or threatened to be made, a party
         to any action or proceeding other than as described in the
         preceding sentence (i.e., other than one by or in the right
         of the Zope Foundation to procure a judgment in its favor),
         whether civil or criminal, including an action by or in the
         right of any other organization of any type or kind, domestic
         or foreign, or any partnership, joint venture, trust,
         employee benefit plan or other enterprise, which any such
         person served in any capacity at the request of the Zope
         Foundation, by reason of the fact that he, his testator or
         intestate was a director or officer of the Zope Foundation,
         against judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement and
         reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees actually and
         necessarily incurred as a result of such action or
         proceeding, or any appeal therein, if such person acted, in
         good faith, for a purpose which he reasonably believed to be
         in the best interests of the Zope Foundation and, in criminal
         actions or proceedings, in addition, had no reasonable cause
         to believe that his conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding the
         above, the Zope Foundation shall only be subject to these
         indemnification provisions if: (i) the party seeking the
         indemnity provides notice of the claim promptly to the Zope
         Foundation; (ii) the Zope Foundation is given sole control of
         the defense and settlement of the claim; (iii) the Zope
         Foundation receives from the party seeking the indemnity all
         available information, assistance and authority to defend
         such claim; and (iv) the party seeking the indemnity has not
         compromised or settled such proceeding without the Zope
         Foundation’s prior written consent.

   10.2. Expenses incurred by a person described in this section in
         defending a civil or criminal action or proceeding may be
         paid by the Zope Foundation in advance of the final
         disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an
         undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay the
         amounts so advanced if it should be ultimately determined
         that such person is not entitled to be indemnified hereunder.

   10.3. In no event shall individual Members of the Zope Foundation
         be subject to the indemnification and advancement of expenses
         obligations of the Zope Foundation under this section. The
         indemnification and advancement of expenses granted pursuant
         to, or provided by, this section shall not be deemed
         exclusive of any other rights to which a director, officer,
         employee or other agent of the Zope Foundation seeking
         indemnification of expenses may be entitled, whether
         contained in the certificate of incorporation or these
         Bylaws, or in a resolution of the Board, or an agreement
         providing for such indemnification or under law or otherwise;
         provided, that no indemnification may be made to or on behalf
         of any director or officer if a judgment or other final
         adjudication adverse to the director or officer establishes
         that his acts were committed in bad faith or were the result
         of active and deliberate dishonesty and were material to the
         cause of action so adjudicated, or that he personally gained
         in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which he was
         not legally entitled.

   10.4. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Zope
         Foundation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of
         any person who is a director or officer, or was serving at
         the request of the Zope Foundation as a director or officer
         or in any other capacity against any liability asserted
         against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such
         capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such,
         whether or not the Zope Foundation would have the power to
         indemnify him or her under this section.
