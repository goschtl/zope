Changelog
=========

0.2 (unreleased)
----------------

- The ``IFieldDiff`` interface now allows for a ``html_diff`` method
  which will be used if the ``lines`` method is unavailable. This can
  be used to implement a diff which outputs directly to HTML. [malthe]

- Bind schema field to source context to provide a context to the
  field diff instance. [malthe]

- Drop field if either value is ``None``. [malthe]

- Use field.query instead of getattr.

- Using Python's ``doctest`` module instead of depreacted
  ``zope.testing.doctest``.

- Added test extra to declare test dependency on ``zope.component [test]``.
