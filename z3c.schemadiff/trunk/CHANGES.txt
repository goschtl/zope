Changelog
=========

In next release:

- The ``IFieldDiff`` interface now allows for a ``html_diff`` method
  which will be used if the ``lines`` method is unavailable. This can
  be used to implement a diff which outputs directly to HTML. [malthe]

- Bind schema field to source context to provide a context to the
  field diff instance. [malthe]

- Drop field if either value is ``None``. [malthe]

- Use field.query instead of getattr
