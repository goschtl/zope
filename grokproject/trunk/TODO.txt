* zc.buildout has a logging initialization bug (it doesn't tear down
  the logging handler, so subsequent logging calls are multiplied).
  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/zc.buildout/+bug/125729.

* Add a --eggs-directory=... option for the eggs dir.

* silence buildout output and be more informative on the other hand
