* get a better zope3instance recipe that places a startup script in
  the top-level bin directory (so you won't have to reach into
  parts/instance/bin)

* pre-install a <grok:grok package="${package}" /> slug in the
  instance so no ZCML is required.

* pad out example package a bit (perhaps create a few initial files
  that are typical for grok apps)

* silence buildout output and be more informative on the other hand
