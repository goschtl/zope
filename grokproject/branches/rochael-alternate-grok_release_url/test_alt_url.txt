Grokproject with alternative release URL
========================================

Providing an alternative release URL for grokproject is useful if you need to have your own
local mirror for grok.

In this test we will use an alternative release URL for grokproject. It is a "file:///"
URL pointing to a directory with a fake set of grok release information files:

    >>> ls(current_dir, 'test_offline')
    current
    grok-0.555.cfg
    >>> cat(current_dir, 'test_offline', 'current')
    grok-0.555.cfg
    >>> cat(current_dir, 'test_offline', 'grok-0.555.cfg')
    [versions]
    grok = 0.555
    <BLANKLINE>
    >>> alt_url = 'file://' + os.path.join(current_dir, 'test_offline', '')

Go to a directory::

    >>> cd(tempdir)

Check that the directory does not exist::

    >>> rmdir('grokexample')

Then use paster, with a "file:///" url pointing to a fake grok release. We won't run
buildout because the version file is not actually valid::

    >>> paster = current_dir + '/bin/paster create -t grok --no-interactive '
    >>> grok_params = ('grokexample user=a passwd=a run_buildout=false grok_release_url=' +
    ...	               alt_url)
    >>> sh(paster + grok_params)
    /.../bin/paster create -t grok --no-interactive grokexample user=a passwd=a run_buildout=false
    ...

Let's check the contents::

    >>> package_dir = os.path.join(tempdir, 'grokexample')
    >>> ls(package_dir)
    bootstrap.py
    buildout.cfg
    setup.py
    src
    versions.cfg

    >>> software_dir = os.path.join(package_dir, 'src', 'grokexample')
    >>> ls(software_dir)
    __init__.py
    app.py
    app.txt
    app_templates
    configure.zcml
    ftesting.zcml
    static
    tests.py

Let's see if the information in our fake release URL was correctly propagated.

    >>> cat(package_dir, 'versions.cfg')
    # This file contains a list of versions of the various grok modules that
    # belong together.
    # It was downloaded from file://.../test_offline/grok-0.555.cfg
    # when this project was created.
    <BLANKLINE>
    [versions]
    grok = 0.555
    <BLANKLINE>
    ...

    >>> cat(package_dir, 'buildout.cfg')
    [buildout]
    ...
    [eggbasket]
    recipe = z3c.recipe.eggbasket
    eggs = grok
    url = file:///.../grok-eggs-0.555.tgz...
