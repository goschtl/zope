complex, scalable web applications. We offer tools for all, from small
nonprofits to large enterprise systems and high traffic public web applications.

Frameworks
==========

The following are notable frameworks which users are adivsed to look at if
they are looking at entering the world of Zope.

Compose Your Own
================

To compose your own application or framwork from scratch, or see how the
packages within the Zope Framework can work for you, see more information
below.

* `Zope 2 Application Server`_, a mature application server which
      has thrived in enterprise production systems for nearly 10 years.

* `Zope Framework Wiki`_, a place where more information about the Zope
 framwork can be found.

This variety of open source and commercial applications built from
Zope Framework demonstrates a community with years of expertise solving
a wide range of problems. A deeper inspection of the technology reveals
powerful tools for managing complexity by fully leveraging the best
dynamic features of the Python programming language.

Organizational Support
======================

Any large open source community needs support infrastructure and
shepherding of intellectual property. For years this was handled by
Zope Corporation, but now those responsibilities have transitioned to
the `Zope Foundation`_ (founded in 2006).


Python Community Cross-Pollination
===================================

Zope software components are also deployed in the wider Python community; for
example:

* `Twisted`_, an asynchronous network server written in Python
  utilizes *zope.interface*. Some Zope projects come bundled with 
  Twisted to provide Zope with a powerful multi-protocol network layer.
      
* `TurboGears`_, a Python web framework which utilizes zope.interface
  as well as Zope's transaction library.
      
* `buildout`_, originally developed at Zope Corporation, has gained traction outside the
  Zope Community as a Python-based build system for creating, assembling and 
  deploying applications from multiple components.
