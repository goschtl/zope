Welcome to the Zope Community
=============================

We are devoted to solutions to the perennial problems encountered
when building complex, scalable web applications. We offer tools
for all, from small nonprofits to large enterprise systems and
high traffic public web applications.

Unity in Diversity
==================
The Zope Framework is collection of Python-based software
components used as building blocks for a variety of projects,
including:

    * `Plone`_, A powerful, flexible Content Management solution that is 
      easy to install, use and extend.

    * `Zope 2 Application Server`_, a mature application server which
      has thrived in enterprise production systems for nearly 10 years.

`Grok`_, a heavyweight Python web framework aimed at making
      the full power of the Zope Framework accessible to the average
      Python developer.

`Repoze`_, a web framework toolkit integrating WSGI middleware with Zope.


    * ...and a collection of individual web applications
      built using the Zope Framework Components  [#more_zca]_

This variety of open source and commercial applications built from
Zope Framework demonstrates a community with years of expertise solving
a wide range of problems. A deeper inspection of the technology reveals
powerful tools for managing complexity by fully leveraging the best
dynamic features of the Python programming language.

Organizational Support
======================

Any large open source community needs support infrastructure and shepherding
of intellectual property. For years this was handled by Zope Corporation,
but now those responsibilities have transitioned to `Zope Foundation`_


Python Community Cross-Pollination
===================================

Zope software components are also deployed in the wider Python community; for
example:

    * `Twisted`_, an asynchronous network server written in Python
      utilizes *zope.interface*. Some Zope projects come bundled with 
      Twisted to provide Zope with a powerful multi-protocol network layer.
      
    * `TurboGears`_, a Python web framework which utilizes zope.interface
      as well as Zope's transaction library.
      
    * `buildout`_, developed at Zope Corporation, has gained traction outside
      Zope Community as a Python-based build system for creating, assembling and 
      deploying applications from multiple components.
