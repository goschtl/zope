Welcome to the Zope Framework 
=============================

We are devoted to solutions to the perennial problems encountered
when building complex, scalable web applications. We offer tools
for all, from small nonprofits to large enterprise systems and
high traffic public web applications.

Unity in Diversity
==================

The Zope Framework is collection of Python-based software
components used as building blocks for building frameworks, applications, or
custom composing your own bits from scratch.
including:

Frameworks
==========

The following are notable frameworks which users are adivsed to look at if
they are looking at entering the world of Zope.

`Grok`_, a  Python web framework aimed at making the full power of the Zope
Framework accessible to any Python developer.

`BFG`_, a web framework toolkit integrating WSGI middleware with Zope.

Applications
============

Several applications are built atop the Zope Framework, providing rich user
experiences.

* `Plone`_, A powerful, flexible Content Management solution that is easy to
 install, use and extend.

* `Schooltool`_, SchoolTool is a project to develop a common global school
 administration infrastructure that is freely available under an Open Source
 license.

* `Launchpad`_, a web application and web site supporting software development,
 particularly that of free software. Launchpad is developed and maintained by
 Canonical Ltd.

Compose Your Own
================

To compose your own application or framwork from scratch, or see how the
packages within the Zope Framework can work for you, see more information
below.

* `Zope 2 Application Server`_, a mature application server which
      has thrived in enterprise production systems for nearly 10 years.

* `Zope Framework Wiki`_, a place where more information about the Zope
 framwork can be found.

This variety of open source and commercial applications built from
Zope Framework demonstrates a community with years of expertise solving
a wide range of problems. A deeper inspection of the technology reveals
powerful tools for managing complexity by fully leveraging the best
dynamic features of the Python programming language.

Organizational Support
======================

Any large open source community needs support infrastructure and
shepherding of intellectual property. For years this was handled by
Zope Corporation, but now those responsibilities have transitioned to
the `Zope Foundation`_ (founded in 2006).


Python Community Cross-Pollination
===================================

Zope software components are also deployed in the wider Python community; for
example:

* `Twisted`_, an asynchronous network server written in Python
  utilizes *zope.interface*. Some Zope projects come bundled with 
  Twisted to provide Zope with a powerful multi-protocol network layer.
      
* `TurboGears`_, a Python web framework which utilizes zope.interface
  as well as Zope's transaction library.
      
* `buildout`_, originally developed at Zope Corporation, has gained traction outside the
  Zope Community as a Python-based build system for creating, assembling and 
  deploying applications from multiple components.
