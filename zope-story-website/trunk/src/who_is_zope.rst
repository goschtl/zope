    Hundreds of companies and thousands of developers participate in the Zope
    Community.  A liberal BSD-style license called ZPL enables the Zope
    Toolkit projects to freely intermingle code and ideas.

    The `Zope Foundation`_ takes care of business, shepherding Zope's
    intellectual property and providing the server infrastructure needed to
    support community projects.
    
    Professional support and training for Zope solutions can be obtained from
    companies such as `Zope Corporation`_ (the originator of Zope)  and other
    `Zope Solution Providers`_. In addition, the various Zope community sites
    are good places to check for consultants and potential hires.

    .. rubric:: A Brief History of Zope
    
    The beginning of Zope's story goes something like this, in 1996, Jim
    Fulton (CTO of Zope Corporation) was drafted to teach a class on common
    gateway interface (CGI) programming, despite not knowing very much about
    the subject.  CGI programming is a commonly-used web development model
    that allows developers to construct dynamic websites. On his way to the
    class, Jim studied all the existing documentation on CGI. On the way back,
    Jim considered what he didn't like about traditional, CGI-based
    programming environments. From these initial musings, the core of Zope was
    written while flying back from the CGI class.
    
    Zope Corporation (then known as Digital Creations) went on to release
    three open-source software packages to support web publishing: Bobo,
    Document Template, and BoboPOS. These packages were written in a language
    called Python, and provided a web publishing facility, text templating,
    and an object database, respectively. Digital Creations developed a
    commercial application server based on their three opensource
    components. This product was called Principia. In November of 1998,
    investor Hadar Pedhazur convinced Digital Creations to open source
    Principia. These packages evolved into what are now the core components of
    Zope 2.
    
    In 2001, the Zope community began working on a component architecture for
    Zope, but after several years they ended up with something much more:
    Zope 3. While Zope 2 was powerful and popular, Zope 3 was designed to
    bring web application development to the next level.
