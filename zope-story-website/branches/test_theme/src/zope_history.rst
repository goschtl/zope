A Brief History of Zope
=======================

The beginning of Zope's story goes something like this, in 1996, Jim Fulton
(CTO of Zope Corporation) was drafted to teach a class on common gateway
interface (CGI) programming, despite not knowing very much about the subject.
CGI programming is a commonly-used web development model that allows
developers to construct dynamic websites. On his way to the class, Jim studied
all the existing documentation on CGI. On the way back, Jim considered what he
didn’t like about traditional, CGI-based programming environments. From these
initial musings, the core of Zope was written while flying back from the CGI
class.

Zope Corporation (then known as Digital Creations) went on to release three
open-source software packages to support web publishing: Bobo, Document
Template, and BoboPOS. These packages were written in a language called
Python, and provided a web publishing facility, text templating, and an object
database, respectively. Digital Creations developed a commercial application
server based on their three opensource components. This product was called
Principia. In November of 1998, investor Hadar Pedhazur convinced Digital
Creations to open source Principia. These packages evolved into what are now
the core components of Zope 2.

In 2001, the Zope community began working on a component architecture for
Zope, but after several years they ended up with something much more:
Zope 3. While Zope 2 was powerful and popular, Zope 3 was designed to bring
web application development to the next level.
