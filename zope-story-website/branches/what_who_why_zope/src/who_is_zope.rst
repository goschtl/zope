    Zope is an Open Source Community 
    -------------------
    Hundreds of companies and thousands of developers participate in the 
    Zope Community. A liberal BSD-style license called ZPL
    enables the Zope Framework projects to freely intermingle code and ideas.

    A Brief History of Zope
    ------------------------
    
    The beginning of Zope’s story goes something like this, in 1996, Jim Fulton 
    (CTO of Zope Corporation) was drafted to teach a class on common gateway 
    interface (CGI) programming, despite not knowing very much about the subject.
    CGI programming is a commonly-used web development model that allows developers 
    to construct dynamic websites. On his way to the class, Jim studied all the 
    existing documentation on CGI. On the way back, Jim considered what he didn’t
    like about traditional, CGI-based programming environments. From these initial
    musings, the core of Zope was written while flying back from the CGI class.
    
    Zope Corporation (then known as Digital Creations) went on to release three
    open-source software packages to support web publishing: Bobo, Document
    Template, and BoboPOS. These packages were written in a language called Python,
    and provided a web publishing facility, text templating, and an object
    database, respectively. Digital Creations developed a commercial application
    server based on their three opensource components. This product was called
    Principia. In November of 1998, investor Hadar Pedhazur convinced Digital
    Creations to open source Principia. These packages evolved into what are now
    the core components of Zope 2.
    
    In 2001, the Zope community began working on a
    component architecture for Zope, but after several years they ended up with
    something much more: Zope 3. While Zope 2 was powerful and popular, Zope 3 was
    designed to bring web application development to the next level.
