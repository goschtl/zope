  <p class="textbold-three">A Brief History of Zope</p>
  <p class="text">The beginning of Zope’s story goes something like this, in 1996, Jim Fulton 
  (CTO of Zope Corporation) was drafted to teach a class on common gateway 
  interface (CGI) programming, despite not knowing very much about the subject. 
  CGI programming is a commonly-used web development model that allows 
  developers to construct dynamic websites. On his way to the class, Jim studied 
  all the existing documentation on CGI. On the way back, Jim considered what he 
  didn’t like about traditional, CGI-based programming environments. From these 
  initial musings, the core of Zope was written while flying back from the CGI 
  class.</p>
  <p class="text">Zope Corporation (then known as Digital Creations) went on to release three 
  open-source software packages to support web publishing: Bobo, Document 
  Template, and BoboPOS. These packages were written in a language called 
  Python, and provided a web publishing facility, text templating, and an object 
  database, respectively. Digital Creations developed a commercial application 
  server based on their three opensource components. This product was called 
  Principia. In November of 1998, investor Hadar Pedhazur convinced Digital 
  Creations to open source Principia. These packages evolved into what are now 
  the core components of Zope 2.</p>
  <p class="text">In 2001, the Zope community began working on a component architecture for 
  Zope, but after several years they ended up with something much more: Zope 3. 
  While Zope 2 was powerful and popular, Zope 3 was designed to bring web 
  application development to the next level.</p>
