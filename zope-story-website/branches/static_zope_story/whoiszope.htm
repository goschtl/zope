  <p class="textbold-three">A Brief History of Zope</p>
  <p class="text">
  
      The beginning of Zope's story goes something like this, in 1996, Jim Fulton 
      (CTO of Zope Corporation) was drafted to teach a class on common gateway 
      interface (CGI) programming, despite not knowing very much about the subject. 
      CGI programming is a commonly-used web development model that allows 
      developers to construct dynamic websites. On his way to the class, Jim studied 
      all the existing documentation on CGI. On the way back, Jim considered what he 
      didn't like about traditional, CGI-based programming environments. From these 
      initial musings, the core of Zope was written while flying back from the CGI 
      class.
      
  </p>
  <p class="text">
  
      Zope Corporation (then known as Digital Creations) went on to release three 
      open-source software packages to support web publishing: Bobo, Document 
      Template, and BoboPOS. These packages were written in a language called 
      Python, and provided a web publishing facility, text templating, and an object 
      database, respectively. Digital Creations developed a commercial application 
      server based on their three opensource components. This product was called 
      Principia. In November of 1998, investor Hadar Pedhazur convinced Digital 
      Creations to open source Principia. These packages evolved into what are now 
      the core components of Zope 2.

  <p class="text">
  
      In 2001, the Zope community began working on a component architecture for 
      Zope, but after several years they ended up with something much more: Zope 3. 
      While Zope 2 was powerful and popular, Zope 3 was designed to bring web 
      application development to the next level.
