Stabilization
-------------

- Compatibility to which ZODB clients and which ZEO servers? Best would be to
  support Zope 2.9 and Zope 3.4.

- Disallow packing while a storage is recovering.

- Disallow recovering multiple storages in parallel.

- Manager client: setup correctly so that invalidations do not trigger errors

- Manager client: provide current recovery message for a storage that is
  recovering

- The exception branch for ClientDisconnected (StorageError) is not tested
  during unit/functional tests (__apply_storage)

Cleanup
-------

- Offer the `read only` option on RAIDStorage through ZConfig schema.

- Remove print statements and provide logging.

Future
======

- Allow asynchronous backend storages (e.g. for off-site replication)

- Make write access to backend storages parallel (for better write
  performance).

- Balance read requests over varying backends to optimize caching and
  distribute IO load. (Beware of the hard-coded priority queue that we use for
  packing.)

- Allow online reconfiguration of the RAID storage (e.g. for adding or
  removing new backend servers).

- Document how to make the RAID server itself reliable (leveraging the
  statelessness of ZEORaid and a hot standby).

- Verify parallel/backend invalidations + optimize invalidations that they get
  passed on only once.

- Guarantee a recovery rate larger than the rate of new commits (one idea is
  to use a "credit point system").

- Document intention of tests better.

- Allow ZEORaid to startup `quickly` even when a backend zeo server is not
  available (thread-parallelize the opening of storages?)

- When recovering a non-shared blob storage, validate old transactions' blob
  files in addition to their meta data.
