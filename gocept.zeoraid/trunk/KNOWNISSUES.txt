Compatibility with ZODB `versions`
==================================

ZEORaid is not compatible with ZODB versions as those are being deprecated and
actively removed.

ZEORaid has API-compatibility with releases of the ZODB that provide and use
versions but will actively prevent any usage of the version features.
