zope.deprecation
****************

When we started working on Zope 3.1, we noticed that the hardest part of the
development process was to ensure backward-compatibility and correctly mark
deprecated modules, classes, functions, methods and properties. This package
provides a simple function called 'deprecated(names, reason)' to deprecate the
previously mentioned Python objects.
