The Grok introspectors
**********************

:Test-Layer: unit

The Grok introspectors provide methods and functions to introspect
registries, code and the ZODB.

Introspecting Registries
========================

There is a registry introspector available for getting insight infos
about locally registered components like utilities, adapters, event
handlers and other stuff. This specialized introspector is called
``RegistryIntrospector``.

We can create a registry introspector::

  >>> from grokui.introspector.introspector import RegistryIntrospector
  >>> introspector = RegistryIntrospector()

To make this component work, we must have some utilities from the
``zope.introspector`` package available. We grok it to register them::

  >>> import grokcore.component as grok
  >>> grok.testing.grok('zope.introspector')

Introspecting Utilities
-----------------------

We now register a utility, that can be found afterwards::

  >>> from zope.interface import Interface, implements
  >>> from zope.component import provideUtility
  >>> import persistent
  >>> from zope.app.container.contained import Contained

  >>> class ITestUtility(Interface):
  ...   pass

  >>> class TestUtility(persistent.Persistent, Contained):
  ...   implements(ITestUtility)

We register this utility globally and unnamed::

  >>> provideUtility(TestUtility(), provides=ITestUtility, name='')

If we now ask the introspector again for utilities, it provides the
newly registered one::

  >>> info = introspector.getUtilities()
  >>> from pprint import pprint
  >>> pprint(sorted(info))
  [...
   {'component': <TestUtility object at 0x...>,
    'name': '',
    'provided': <InterfaceClass __builtin__.ITestUtility>,
    'registry': <BaseGlobalComponents base>}]
