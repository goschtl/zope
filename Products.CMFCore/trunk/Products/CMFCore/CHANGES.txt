Products.CMFCore Changelog

  Products.CMFCore 2.2.0 (unreleased)

    - TypesTool: Refactored content creation.
      Moved notifyWorkflowCreated and indexObject calls to IObjectAddedEvent
      handler. Please make sure all oldstyle content factory methods use
      _setObject with suppress_events=True. CMF factory methods don't finish
      object creation, so they should not send the IObjectAddedEvent.

    - interfaces: Added ICatalogAware for CMFCatalogAware methods.

    - setup handlers: All import and export steps are now registered globally.

    - MembershipTool: Removed ancient LoginManager compatibility code and
      deprecated the no longer needed __getPUS method.

    - interfaces: Removed deprecated oldstyle interfaces.
