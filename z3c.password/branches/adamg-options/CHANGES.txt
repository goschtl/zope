0.5.1 (unreleased)

- Added Russian translation

- Refactor PrincipalMixIn now() into a separate method to facilitate
  override and testing

- Changed the order the password is checked:
  1. check password against stored
  2. check maxFailedAttempts, raise TooManyLoginFailures if over
  3. if password is OK, check expirationDate, raise PasswordExpired if over
  4. return whether password matches

  This is because I need to be sure that PasswordExpired is raised only if the
  password *IS* valid. Entering an invalid password *MUST NOT* raise
  PasswordExpired, because I want to use PasswordExpired to allow the user
  to change it's password. This should not happen if the user did not enter a
  valid password.
