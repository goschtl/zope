0.2 (unreleased)
================

* Added support for ``RelationList`` fields. This allows one to
  maintain a list of ``RelationValue`` objects that will be cataloged
  like the regular ``Relation`` fields.

* Get rid of IRelationInfo adapter requirement. Just define a
  ``create_relation`` function that does the same work.

0.1 (2008-12-05)
================

* Initial public release.
