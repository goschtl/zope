- Security middleware: ensure that endInteraction is called even if the
  application raises an exception.

- Publication: ensure that the traversal key is a unicode string, decoding it
  from the request's charset.

0.1.2 (2009-08-19)
------------------

- Reduced dependency on zope.component: do not require the zcml extra anymore.

0.1.1 (2009-08-18)
------------------

- Use the IRequest interface from the z3c.request package; this will simplify
  the dependencies of packages providing components which are not dependent on
  a specific implementation of the request object.

------------------

- First public release.
