CHANGES
=======

0.1.2 (2009-08-19)
------------------

- Reduced dependency on zope.component: do not require the zcml extra anymore.

0.1.1 (2009-08-18)
------------------

- Use the IRequest interface from the z3c.request package; this will simplify
  the dependencies of packages providing components which are not dependent on
  a specific implementation of the request object.

------------------

- First public release.
