Non-ZPL documentation resources can be checked into this directory if you
have received explicit permission from the Zope Foundation to do so. The
workflow currently is simply to mail Martijn Faassen (faassen@startifact.com)
with a description of what you want to do.

In order to use these documentation resources in your own sphinx project,
create a subdirectory here and an svn:external to that subdirectory from
the sphinx project in question.
