================

- initial version on zope.org


2007/08/27 0.3.0
================

- separated all o2o configuration into it's own configuration file. This is
  done because of the event handler which adds a lot of overhead to projects

Existing projects need to include the file "o2o.zcml" in their application
configuration !

===================

- access to the relation object using PropertyRelationManager

- relation properties can now be used to provide uids instead of the objects.

- provide a dump method which allows the use of intids for queries instead of
  objects. This is now the default for all newly created relation containers.

- set dependency to zc.relationship to <= 1.999
