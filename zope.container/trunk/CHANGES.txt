3.7.1 (unreleased)
------------------

- Moved import of ``IBroken`` interface to use new ``zope.broken``
  package, which has no dependencies beyond ``zope.interface``.

- Made ``test`` part pull in the extra test requirements of this package.

- Split the ``z3c.recipe.compattest`` configuration out into a new file,
  ``compat.cfg``, to reduce the burden of doing standard unit tests.

- Stripped out bogus develop eggs from ``buildout.cfg``.

3.7.0 (2009-01-31)
------------------

- Split this package off ``zope.app.container``. This package is
  intended to have far less dependencies than ``zope.app.container``.

- This package also contains the container implementation that
  used to be in ``zope.app.folder``.
