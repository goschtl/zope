CMFSetup Product README

  Overview

    This product provides a mini-framework for expressing the configured
    state of a CMF Site as a set of filesystem artifacts.  These artifacts
    consist of declarative XML files, which spell out the configuration
    settings for each tool, and supporting scripts / templates, in their
    "canonical" filesystem representations.

  Configurations Included

    The 'portal_setup' tool knows how to export / import configurations
    and scripts for the following tools:

      - (x) itself :)

      - (x) the role / permission map on the site object

      - ( ) removal / creation of specified tools

      - ( ) cookie crumbler configuration

      - ( ) folder structure

      - ( ) 'portal_actionicons'
            (Products.CMFActionIcons.ActionIconsTool.ActionIconsTool)

            o action title / icon bindings

      - (x) 'portal_actions'
            (Products.CMFCore.ActionsTool.ActionsTool)
 
            o action providers, and their actions; note that this removes
              the requirement to have individual tools configure their own
              actions

      - ( ) 'portal_catalogs'
            (Products.CMFCore.CatalogTool.CatalogTool)

            o index names / types
        
            o metadata column names

      - ( ) 'portal_membership'

            o "skeleton" home folder (XXX: is this in the core?)

      - ( ) 'portal_memberdata'

            o member properties

      - (x) 'portal_skins'

            o tool properties

            o FilesystemDirectoryView instances

            o skin path definitions

      - ( ) 'portal_types'

            o content type definitions, including actions

      - ( ) 'portal_workflow'

            o bindings of workflows to content types

            o DCWorkflow definitions, including supporting scripts

  Extending The Tool

    Third-party products extend the tool by registering handlers for
    import / export of their unique tools.
