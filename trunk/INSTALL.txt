Overview

 The tarball for this product does *not* unpack to
 'lib/python/FSDump';  rather it unpacks to
 'FSDump-x.x'.  I made this choice for two reasons:

  * More and more Zope installations are using an
    'INSTANCE_HOME' layout, which divides the "core"
    Zope software (installed in '$SOFTWARE_HOME') from
    the products and data specific to a particular
    Zope instance (installed in '$INSTANCE_HOME').
    '$INSTANCE_HOME' does not put products into a
    'lib/python/Products' directory, but simply into
    'Products'.  See Evan Simpson's "INSTANCE_HOME
    how-to":/Members/4am/instancehome for more.


  * I am finding it needful to maintain multiple versions
    of some products on my filesystem, and to switch
    easily among them.  I therefore want each version to
    be in a separate directory, with the version mangled
    into the name.

Installing into 'SOFTWARE_HOME'

 If you are not using 'INSTANCE_HOME', and just want the
 product to be installed into the 'lib/python/Products'
 directory:

  1. Unpack the product into a temporary directory.  It
     will create a directory, 'FSDump-x.y'.

  2. Move this directory into the 'lib/python/Products'
     directory of you Zope '$SOFTWARE_HOME'.

  3. Rename it to 'FSDump'.

  4. Restart Zope.

 If you'd like to maintain the version numbered directory
 somewhere (on a Unix-style filesystem):

  1. Unpack the product into the directory where you keep
     product tarballs.  It will create a directory,
     'FSDump-x.y'.

  2. Symlink this directory into the 'lib/python/Products'
     directory of you Zope '$SOFTWARE_HOME', naming the
     link 'FSDump'.

  3. Restart Zope.

Installing into 'INSTANCE_HOME'

 If you *are* using 'INSTANCE_HOME', and just want the
 product to be installed into the 'Products'
 directory:

  1. Unpack the product into a temporary directory.  It
     will create a directory, 'FSDump-x.y'.

  2. Move this directory into the 'Products'
     directory of you Zope '$INSTANCE_HOME'.

  3. Rename it to 'FSDump'.

  4. Restart Zope.
