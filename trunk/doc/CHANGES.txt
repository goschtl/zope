PluggableAuthService changelog

  HEAD
  
    Bugs Fixed
    
      - Added WARNING-level logs with tracebacks for all swallowed
        plugin exceptions, so that you notice that there is something
        wrong with the plugins.

      - All authenticateCredentials() returned a single None when they
        could not authenticate, although all calls expected a tuple.
      
      - The user id in extract user now calls _verifyUser to get the ID 
        mangled by the enumeration plugin, instead of mangling it with the
        authentication ID, thereby allowing the authentication and 
        enumeration plugins to be different plugins.
        
              
  Version 1.0.2 (2004/07/15)

    Bugs Fixed

      - ZODBRoleManager and ZODBGroupManager needed the "two_lists" view,
        and associated images, which migrated to the PluginRegsitry product
        when they split;  restored them.

  Version 1.0.1 (2004/05/18)

    Bugs Fixed
    
      - CookieAuth plugin didn't successfully set cookies (first, because
        of a NameError, then, due to a glitch with long lines).

      - Missing ZPL in most modules.

  Version 1.0 (2004/04/29)

    - Initial release
