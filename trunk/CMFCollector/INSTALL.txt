Installing CMFCollector

  The CMFCollector is an issue collector for Zope.

  Prerequisites:

   - Zope, 2.4 or better (Python 2.x) and the following addons.

   - The CMF

     Version 1.2 or better.

   - Zope Page templates

     "ZPT", http://www.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZPT
     ZPT is part of the Zope distribution as of version 2.5

   - the Skins tool in the CMF must be set up to use ZPT views:
     you must have at least the 'collector' and 'zpt_generic' 
     layers included on the skin you're using.
     
     The installation script will add the 'collector' layer
     to any existing skins for you.

  To install CMFCollector:

  - Uncompress the CMFCollector product into your zope/Products
    directory or link it there, e.g.::

    ln -s /path/to/installation /path/to/zope/Products

  - In the root of your CMFSite installation (within the ZMI), add an
    external method to the root of the CMF Site, with the following
    configuration values:

      o id: install_collector

      o title (optional): Install Collector Content Types

      o module name: CMFCollector.Install

      o function name: install

    Go to the management screen for the newly added external method and
    click the 'Test' tab.

    The install function will execute and give information about the
    steps it took to register and install the CMF Events into the CMF
    Site instance.

  - Finally, install the workflow:

     1. Put collector_issue_workflow.zexp in your site's import/
        directory.

     2. Within the portal's portal_workflow 'Contents' tab:

        o hit the 'Import/Export' button

        o fill in Import File Name: collector_issue_workflow.zexp

        o hit 'import'

     3. Within the portal_workflow 'Workflows' tab, fill in:

        Collector Issue: collector_issue_workflow

        ... and hit the "Change" button.

   Then the workflow will be associated with any new issues you create.
