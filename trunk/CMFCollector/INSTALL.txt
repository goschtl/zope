Installing CMFCollector

  The CMFCollector is an issue collector for Zope.

  Prerequisites:

   - Zope, 2.4 or better (with page templates, Python 2.x)

   - The CMF ( http://cmf.zope.org ), recent (as of 10/10/2001) CVS
     checkout, or (not yet released) 1.2 or better.

   - Zope Page templates (ZPT, http://www.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZPT )

   - CMFDecor provisions for ZPT, including use of the ZPT skin as the
     default skin (settable from the portal_skins 'Properties' tab).

  To install CMFCollector, uncompress the CMFCollector product into
  your zope/Products directory or link it there, e.g.::

    ln -s /path/to/installation /path/to/zope/Products

  In the root of your CMFSite installation (within the ZMI):

      1.  Add an external method to the root of the CMF Site.

      2.  Use the following configuration values for the external
          method:

          o id: install_collector

          o title (optional): Install Collector Content Types

          o module name: CMFCollector.InstallCollector

          o function name: install_collector

      3. Go to the management screen for the newly added external
         method and click the 'Try it' tab.  

  The install function will execute and give information about the
  steps it took to register and install the CMF Events into the CMF
  Site instance.
