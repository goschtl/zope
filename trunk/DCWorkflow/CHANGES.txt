Version 0.2

- As suggested by Seb Bacon, simplified by making transitions trigger on
their own IDs.  Thanks!
 
- Added script invocation just before execution of a transition.  Scripts
are passed an expression namespace as the first parameter.
 
- Replaced the name "action_or_method" with "transition".

Version 0.1

- Initial release.
