  Bug Fixes

    - FSPageTemplate: Refine the XML content type detection so that
      addtional data such as encoding is preserved
      (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/228)

    - ActionInformation: If a path expression ending in an object that
      gets called using __render_with_namespace__ (such as DTML objects
      and Scripts (Python)) is used a KeyError for "here" would be thrown
      inside PageTemplates.ZRPythonExpr.call_with_ns. call_with_ns
      expects the namespace to contain "here", which the context coming
      from CMFCore.Expressions.createExprContext did not provide. Added
      "here" as an alias pointing to the provided "object"
      (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/171)

    - http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/205: When pasting a content item,
      local roles were not changed to reflect the neew ownership.
