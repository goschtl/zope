After 1.5.0beta

  New Features

    - Feature

  Bugs Fixed

    - ActionInformation: If a path expression ending in an object that
      gets called using __render_with_namespace__ (such as DTML objects
      and Scripts (Python)) is used a KeyError for "here" would be thrown 
      inside PageTemplates.ZRPythonExpr.call_with_ns. call_with_ns
      expects the namespace to contain "here", which the context coming
      from CMFCore.Expressions.createExprContext did not provide. Added
      "here" as an alias pointing to the provided "object"
      (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/171)

    - http://www.zope.org/Collectors/cmf/205: When pasting a content item,
      local roles were not changed to reflect the neew ownership.

    - ActionsTool: Removed deprecated support for oldstyle Action Providers.
      If Action Providers don't implement the ActionProvider interface they
      are now ignored.

    - Workflow: Removed deprecated WorkflowMethod machinery.
