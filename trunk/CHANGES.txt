Zelenium Product Changelog

  After Zelenium-0.3.1
 
    - Force Zuite objects to show order support, even in the presence of
      ExternalEditor, whose monkey patching seems to trip it up.  Surface
      the EE icon, if the product is available

      Note:  we are *forking* OFS/dtml/main.dtml and the version in
      ExteranalEditor/manage_main.dtml to surface order support, which
      is a pretty brutal hack.  We should probably get ExteranalEditor
      fixed, instead, and rip out the forked copy.
