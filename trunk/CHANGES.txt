CMF 1.5alpha (unreleased)

  New Features

    - TypeInformation: Added Method Aliases.

      o TypesTool and TypeInformation now have an 'Aliases' tab to configure
        Method Aliases TTW.

      o factory_type_information now has a key 'aliases' to configure Method
        Aliases in a product. This key is required, but may be empty: If it
        doesn't exist, TypeInformation will try to update by guessing aliases.

      o DynamicType manipulates 'TraversalRequestNameStack' depending on
        Method Aliases. '(Default)' and 'view' aliases bypass __call__() and
        view() methods on traversal.

      o PortalFolder's 'mkdir' hook now makes use of Method Aliases.

    - MembershipTool (CMFCore and CMFDefault): Changed member area creation.
      'wrapUser()' does no longer call 'createMemberarea()'.
      'createMemberarea()' should now be called from the 'logged_in' page.

    - MembershipTool (CMFDefault): Added a customization hook to
      'createMemberarea()'. A 'createMemberContent' script placed inside the
      tool overrides default member content creation.

  Bug Fixes

    - Collector #153: CookieCrumbler didn't preserve query strings.
