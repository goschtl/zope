External Editor Change Log

    - Added support for domain specific configuration options.

    - Fixed trailing newline bug in encoded auth data coming from
      CookieCrumbler. Thanks to Harald Koschinski.

    - You can now pass command line arguments to the editor in the config file,
      or wrap the editor in an xterm without using a shell script.
      
    - Rewrote "Editor did not launch" error message so it makes more sense.

      https. Many thanks to Hans-Dieter Stich and Martin Grönemeyer for their 
      assistance and ideas.

    - Made it possible to edit objects that are methods of ZClasses. Thanks to
      Jim Washington

      Jim Washington

      Thanks to Gabriel Genellina for pointing this out.
