   Monkey-patch Zope's external method machinery to look for external
   method files in exploded tempdirs (thanks to Rocky Burt).

   Unpack non-zip-safe eggs into a cache directory instead of a
   per-process temp directory (thanks to Rocky Burt).

   Fix missing imports and missing function parameters which exposed
   failures only during certain error condidions (thanks to Rocky Burt).

   Fixed a bug where inspecting a zipfile distribution which was later
   blown out to a tempdir caused inappropriate turds to be left on
   that distributions' namespace packages' __path__(s).
