External Editor Change Log

    - External editing is now governed by the "Use external editor" permission
      to allow non-managers to use it. Users must also have the permissions to
      edit/modify the objects they edit, plus do WebDAV locking if desired.
      Thanks to Reineke and others.

    - Unix editor command line parsing is much more robust now and properly
      handles quoted arguments. You can also specify the "$1" placeholder in the
      editor command to denote where the content file name is inserted. If
      omitted it is appended to the end of the command line. "%1" continues to
      work similarly for Windows. Thanks to Marc St-Jean.

    - Fixed bug editing large (chunked) files and images. External editor now
      streams their data properly to the client. Thanks to all the users who
      reported various symptoms of this bug.

    - Fixed bug editing objects inside a Squishdot site. Thanks to Kevin Salt.

    - Added the capability to borrow exising DAV locks. This allows external
      editor to play well with other systems using locks, such as CMFStaging. A
      new configuration flag, always_borrow_locks can be set to suppress the
      borrow lock warning dialog when editing.

    - Fixed auth bug when product was used with mysqlUserFolder. Thanks to
      ViNiL.

    - Added SSL support to Windows binary package. Thanks to Federico 
      Sevilla III

  6/29/02 - 0.4.1 Release

    - Fixed dangling dav lock bug on fatal errors. Thanks to Marc St-Jean.

    - Fixed content_type bug, now checks if it is callable. Thanks to Arnaud 
      Bienvenu.

    - Fixed bug setting the editor on Posix platforms.

  6/24/02 - 0.4 Release

    - Added --version command line argument

    - Made manage_FTPget the default source for the editable content, instead
      of document_src which was broken for CMF Wiki Pages.

    - Fixed Windows "body_file" bug.

    - Added binary build support for Windows using py2exe and Inno setup.

    - Fixed Windows config file locator. It now looks in the program directory
      and then the user's home directory (if specified)

    - Fixed bug in Windows registry editor lookup.

  6/16/02 - 0.3 Release

    - Improved behavior when saving after lock attempts fail.

    - Now works on Windows (applause) using Pythonwin. Much overall
      refactoring to abstract process control. Thanks to Oliver Deckmyn,
      Gabriel Genellina and Arno Gross for testing, patches and suggestions.

    - Added "temp_dir" configuration option for specifying a different
      temp file directory then the OS default. Also further improved 
      temp file name generation.

    - Added support for domain specific configuration options.

    - Fixed trailing newline bug in encoded auth data coming from
      CookieCrumbler. Thanks to Harald Koschinski.

    - You can now pass command line arguments to the editor in the config file,
      or wrap the editor in an xterm without using a shell script.
      
    - Rewrote "Editor did not launch" error message so it makes more sense.

    - Fixed https detection bug. External editor is now tested and working with
      https. Many thanks to Hans-Dieter Stich and Martin Grönemeyer for their 
      assistance and ideas.

    - Made it possible to edit objects that are methods of ZClasses. Thanks to
      Jim Washington

    - Refactored link generation code in manage_main so that it uses
      the parent's absolute_url rather than URL1. Thanks to
      Jim Washington

    - Removed implicit save in Configuration class destructor

    - Added caching headers to prevent client-side caching of edit data.
      Thanks to Gabriel Genellina for pointing this out.

    - Added improved support for editing CMF documents

    - Eliminated spurious "Editor did not launch" errors on short sessions
      or when other errors occurred.
