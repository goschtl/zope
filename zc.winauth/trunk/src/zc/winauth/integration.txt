======================
Windows Authentication
======================

This package provides for authenticating windows users with their domain
user names and passwords.

WindowsAuthenticationPlugin
===========================

The authentication is done via a WindowsAuthenticationPlugin.

    >>> from zc.winauth.winauth import WindowsAuthenticationPlugin
    >>> wap = WindowsAuthenticationPlugin()

When a user needs to be authenticated there credentials are passed to the
plugin.

    >>> credentials = {'login': 'testy', 'password': 'test'}

The result of authentication is the principal's name with a prefix, and a
little information about the principal.

    >>> info = wap.authenticateCredentials(credentials)
    >>> info is not None
    True

Winauth uses the Windows SID as part of the ID.

    >>> info.id
    u'...S-...-...-...'
    >>> info.title
    u'Testy Testerson'

If an unknown user name or incorrect password are given, None is returned.

    >>> badCredentials = {'login': 'testy', 'password': 'wrong'}
    >>> wap.authenticateCredentials(badCredentials) is None
    True

If a bad ID is used to get principal info, no info is returned:

    >>> print wap.principalInfo('zc.winauth.bad')
    None
