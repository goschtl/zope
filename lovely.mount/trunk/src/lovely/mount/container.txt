====================
Mountpoint Container
====================

The mountpoint container is an IContainer implementation which returns
its values from another database.

    >>> from lovely.mount import container
    >>> mpc = container.MountpointContainer('2')
    >>> root['mpc'] = mpc

If a mountpoint is created, the mountpoint has to be commited. Otherwise it's
not possible to determine on which connection it should be stored.

    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> from zope.site.folder import Folder
    >>> f = Folder()
    >>> mpc['f'] = f

    >>> transaction.commit()
