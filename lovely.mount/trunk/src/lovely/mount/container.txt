====================
Mountpoint Container
====================

The mountpoint container is an IContainer implementation which returns
its values from another database.

    >>> from lovely.mount import container
    >>> mpc = container.MountpointContainer('2')
    >>> root['mpc'] = mpc
    
If a mountpoint is created, the mountpoint has to be commited. Otherwise it's 
not possible to determine on which connection it should be stored.

    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> from zope.app.folder import Folder
    >>> f = Folder()
    >>> mpc['f'] = f
    
    >>> transaction.commit()
