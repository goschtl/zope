Changes
=======

3.5.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- Remove zope.testing from dependencies, as it's not really needed.

- Define IIndexSort interface for indexes that support sorting and
  implement it in the FieldIndex.

- Add an ``apply`` method for KeywordIndex, making it implementing
  IIndexSearch that can be useful in catalog.

- Make KeywordIndex use IFSets instead of IISets. This makes it more
  compatible with other indexes. 

- Optimize the ``search`` method of KeywordIndex by using multiunion
  for the ``or`` operator and sorting before intersection for ``and``.

Thanks Chris McDonough of repoze for supporting and useful code.
