Changes
=======

3.5.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- Remove zope.testing from dependencies, as it's not really needed.

- Define IIndexSort interface for indexes that support sorting.

- Implement sorting for FieldIndex (adapted from repoze.catalog/ZCatalog).

- Add an ``apply`` method for KeywordIndex/TopicIndex, making them
  implement IIndexSearch that can be useful in catalog.

- Optimize the ``search`` method of KeywordIndex/TopicIndex by using
  multiunion for the ``or`` operator and sorting before intersection for ``and``.

- IMPORTANT: KeywordIndex/TopicIndex now use IFSets instead of IISets.
  This makes it more compatible with other indexes (for example, when
  using in catalog). This change can lead to problems, if your code somehow
  depends on the II nature of sets, as it was before.
  
  Also, FilteredSets used to use IFSets as well, if you have any
  FilteredSets pickled in the database, you need to migrate them to
  IFSets yourself. You can do it like that:
  
      filter._ids = filter.family.IF.Set(filter._ids)
  
  Where ``filter`` is an instance of FilteredSet.

Thanks Chris McDonough of repoze for supporting and useful code.
