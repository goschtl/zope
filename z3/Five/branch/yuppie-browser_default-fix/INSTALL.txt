How to install Five
-------------------

Requirements for Five 1.2
=========================

* Zope 2.8.1+ with Python 2.3.x.

Note that Five 1.0 is already part of Zope 2.8.  This doesn't matter,
though, you can still install Five 1.2 into your Zope 2.8 instances.
It will override Zope's older version of Five.

Running the tests
=================

For information on how to install the automatic Five tests, please see
``tests/README.txt``.
