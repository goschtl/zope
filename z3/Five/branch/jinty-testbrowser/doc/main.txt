Five, the Zope 3 in Zope 2 project
==================================
       
What is Five?
-------------

Five is a Zope 2 product that allows you to integrate Zope 3
technologies into Zope 2, today.  Among others, it allows you to use
Zope 3 interfaces, ZCML-based configuration, adapters, browser pages
(including skins, layers, and resources), automated add and edit forms
based on schemas, object events, as well as Zope 3-style i18n message
catalogs.

We've tried to keep the Five experience as close to Zope 3 as
possible, so this means that what you learn while using Five should
also be applicable to Zope 3, and viceversa.

Five 1.0 and 1.1 work on a straight Zope 2.7 installation, as long as
Zope 3 has been installed.  Five 1.2 requires Zope 2.8 which already
ships with Zope 3, Five 1.3 is included in Zope 2.9.

We're in the process of evaluating lots more Zope 3 technologies for
integration into Zope 2.  This is the right moment for interested Zope
2 and Zope 3 developers to jump in.  We're looking for cooperation
between different Zope 2 projects so that this can be a foundational
system for us all.
