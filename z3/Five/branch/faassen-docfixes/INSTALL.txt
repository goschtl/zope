How to install Five
-------------------

Requirements for Five 0.1
=========================

* Zope 2.7.x with python 2.3.x

* Zope X3.0.0 Beta 2

Installing Five
===============

Installing Five is relatively straightforward. 

* Select a Zope 2.7 instance.

* Download and install Zope X3.00 Beta 2. You can compile its C code
  by typing ``make``. On windows it is easier to use a binary release
  of Zope X3 instead.

* You need to make your Zope 2.7 instance aware of Zope 3 so it can
  import packages from it. To do this, go to the etc/zope.conf of your
  Zope 2.7 instance and add a ``path`` entry to your Zope 3's ``src``
  directory, i.e.::

  path /path/to/Zope3/src

* Next, install the Five product into your Zope 2.7 instance as a
  product and restart Zope. Five should now be installed.

* You can also install various products in the ``demo`` subdirectory of
  Five by copying them into your ``Products`` directory.
