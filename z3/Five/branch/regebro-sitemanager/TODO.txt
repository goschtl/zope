v1.1.1 (...)
------------

- more tests for browser.adding (faassen?)

- more extensive testing whether event system works with things like
  Zope 2 folders etc. (faassen?)

- ensuring that the event-sending behavior is as close to Zope 3's as
  possible.  A lot of edge cases with different behavior likely
  remain, and things like IObjectModifiedEvents are not sent yet for
  folders. (faassen?)


v2.0 (mid-August, to ship with Zope 2.9)
----------------------------------------

- Zope 3.1 support

- Drop old-style ExtensionClass support (and all other support for Zope 2.7)

- Possibly: introduce site concept, make rendering of resource urls
  support sites.  Merge Sidnei's localsitemanager branch (will
  probably have to be fixed up for component architecture refactoring
  in Zope 3.1) (sidnei)

- if Zope 2.9 includes the new test runner: convert functional test
  cases to true ftests (configuration is loaded once before all ftests
  are run; they're run separately from the unit tests).


v2.1 (...)
----------

- l10n (philikon)

- Allow Zope2 boilerplate context.registerClass be configured through zcml

- Figure out where add-view redirects should go.

- Instructions on using add views.

- HTTP/WebDAV: support dispatching of all HTTP/WebDAV methods to HTTP
  views.  If lookup fails, fall back to methods on the object (Zope 2
  style).  Security is implied by HTTP views.

- FTP: allow manage_FTPstat, manage_FTPget, manage_FTPlist to dispatch to
  filerepresentation adapters.  Make sure to handle security correctly.

- Icons through <browser:icon>?

- Grant security stuff through ZCML (<grant />)?

- top-level <require />, <allow /> directives as a ZCML spelling of
  allowModule, allowClass
