============================
zope.formlib support in Five
============================

Five supports zope.formlib, an alternative for constructing add, edit, and
other forms based on schema. See zope/formlib/form.txt for a thorough
description of the functionality provided by formlib.

Formlib forms are normal view classes, registered as browser pages. The
view class needs to subclass one of the baseclasses provided by
Products.Five.formlib.formbase.

In almost all cases you need to import from zope.formlib.from as well, in
order to define and select fields and to add actions to your form.

See Products.Five.formlib.tests for a minimal example.
