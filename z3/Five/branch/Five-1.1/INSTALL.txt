How to install Five
-------------------

Requirements for Five 1.1
=========================

* Zope 2.7.4+ with Python 2.3.x.  Zope versions lower than Zope 2.7.4
  may work, but no guarantees.  Zope 2.8.1 or higher is recommended.

* Zope X3 3.0.1, found here: http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope3/3.0.1/
  (not Zope 3.1 or higher!).  Zope X3 3.0.1 already ships with Zope
  2.8.1.

Note that Five 1.0 is already part of Zope 2.8.  This doesn't matter,
though, you can still install Five 1.1 into your Zope 2.8 instances.
It will override Zope's older version of Five.

Installing Five and Zope X3 for Zope 2.7
========================================

Installing Five is relatively straightforward. 

* Select a Zope 2.7 instance.

* Download and install Zope X3 3.0.1. You can get it compiled and
  installed by:

    * Typing ``configure``. When you're experimenting, typically you
      want to use the ``--prefix`` directive to install the binaries
      to install it somewhere in your homedirectory.

    * ``make``
  
    * ``make install``

  On windows you can install choose to use the binary release instead.

  Alternatively you can check out the latest subversion version of
  Zope X3.0 and typing ``make`` to produce it in-place.

* You need to make your Zope 2.7 instance aware of Zope 3 so it can
  import the ``zope``, ``persistent`` and ``transaction`` packages from it.

* In non-ZEO setups, you can simply go to the ``etc/zope.conf`` of
  your Zope 2.7 instance and add a ``path`` entry. If you used the
  released version of Zope X3.0.0, use something like the following::

    path /path/to/installed/Zope3/lib/python

  If you are instead using the subversion version, use::

    path /path/to/Zope3/src

  If you have problems however, see the instructions for the ZEO
  setup.

* In ZEO setups (or some other circumstances), Zope 3's ZEO packages
  will interfere with Zope 2's. In this case you can create a new
  directory, symlink the ``zope``, ``persistent`` and ``transaction``
  packages in it and use this directory for the ``path`` entry in the
  ``etc/zope.conf`` of your Zope 2.7 instance.

* Next, install the Five product into your Zope 2.7 instance as a
  product and restart Zope. Five should now be installed.

* You can also install various products in the ``doc/products``
  subdirectory of Five by copying them into your ``Products``
  directory.
