How to install Five
-------------------

Installing Five is relatively straightforward. 

* You need a Zope 2.7 instance.

* You also need an installation of Zope 3. Later on we may produce a
  Five-specific distribution of the Zope 3 components that are needed,
  but for now just use Zope 3. You can install it by typing 'make'.

* You need to make your Zope 2.7 instance aware of Zope 3 it can
  import packages from it. To do this, go to the etc/zope.conf of your
  Zope 2.7 instance and add a ``path`` entry to your Zope 3's ``src``
  directory, i.e.::

  path /path/to/Zope3/src

* Next, install the Five product into your Zope 2.7 instance as a
  product and restart Zope. Five should now be installed.

* You can also install ``demo/FiveDemo`` and
  ``demo/FiveViewsDemo``. For more about what these demos, see
  ``README.txt``.
