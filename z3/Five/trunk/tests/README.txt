Five tests
==========

The tests require ZopeTestCase to be installed. ZopeTestCase can be
downloaded from here:

http://zope.org/Members/shh/ZopeTestCase

it needs to be installed in your Zope software's lib/python/Testing
directory.

Then, if you have Zope 2.7.3 or better all you have to do is type::

  ./bin/zopectl test --dir Products/Five

to run the Five tests.
