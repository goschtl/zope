Test events
===========

Before we can start, we need to set up an event subscriber that allows
us to inspect events that will be thrown during the test:

  >>> from zope.app.event.tests.placelesssetup import PlacelessSetup
  >>> PlacelessSetup().setUp()

Now make our stub class send events:

  >>> from Products.Five.eventconfigure import classSendEvents
  >>> from Products.Five.tests.simplecontent import SimpleContent
  >>> classSendEvents(SimpleContent)

Add a folder that doesn't verify objects on paste.  We use it as a
test sandbox:

  >>> from Products.Five.testing import manage_addNoVerifyPasteFolder
  >>> manage_addNoVerifyPasteFolder(self.folder, 'npvf')
  >>> folder = self.folder.npvf

Finally add a manager user login, give it the right permissions and
log in using it:

  >>> uf = self.folder.acl_users
  >>> uf._doAddUser('manager', 'r00t', ['Manager'], [])
  >>> self.setPermissions(standard_permissions + ['Copy or Move'], 'Manager')
  >>> self.login('manager')

  >>> from zope.app.event.tests.placelesssetup import getEvents, clearEvents


Added event
------------

Let's add an object to a folder:

  >>> from Products.Five.tests.simplecontent import manage_addSimpleContent
  >>> manage_addSimpleContent(folder, 'foo', 'Foo')

One object event should have been sent with the event's object being
our foo object:

  >>> events = getEvents()
  >>> len(events)
  1
  >>> foo = folder.foo
  >>> events[0].object == foo
  True

That object event should have been an object added event:

  >>> from zope.app.container.interfaces import IObjectAddedEvent
  >>> events = getEvents(IObjectAddedEvent)
  >>> len(events)
  1
  >>> events[0].object == foo
  True
  >>> events[0].newParent == foo.aq_parent
  True

Now clean up:

  >>> clearEvents()


Moved event (I) -- Renaming
--------------------------

Somehow we need to at least commit a subtransaction to make renaming
succeed:

  >>> import transaction
  >>> transaction.commit(1)

Let's rename the object we created before:

  >>> folder.manage_renameObject('foo', 'bar')

We should get two events...

  >>> events = getEvents()
  >>> len(events)
  2

the removed event...

  >>> events[0].object == foo
  True
  >>> events[0].oldName
  'foo'
  >>> events[0].newName
  >>> events[0].oldParent == folder
  True
  >>> events[0].newParent

and the moved event:

  >>> events[1].oldName
  'foo'
  >>> events[1].newName
  'bar'
  >>> events[1].oldParent == folder
  True
  >>> events[1].newParent == folder
  True

Now clean up:

  >>> folder.manage_delObjects(['bar'])
  >>> clearEvents()

We don't delete the stub object just yet because it's being used in
the next part of the test.


Moved event (II) -- Cut and paste
---------------------------------

Let's move from one folder to another:

  >>> manage_addNoVerifyPasteFolder(folder, 'folder1', 'Folder1')
  >>> folder1 = folder.folder1
  >>> manage_addNoVerifyPasteFolder(folder, 'folder2', 'Folder2')
  >>> folder2 = folder.folder2
  >>> manage_addSimpleContent(folder1, 'foo', 'Foo')
  >>> foo = folder1.foo

We need to trigger a subtransaction before cut/paste can work:

  >>> transaction.commit(1)
  >>> cb = folder1.manage_cutObjects(['foo'])
  >>> info = folder2.manage_pasteObjects(cb)

Apart from the added event we triggerred when we added the stub object
to the folder, we expect two events...

  >>> events = getEvents()
  >>> len(events)
  3
  >>> len(getEvents(IObjectAddedEvent))
  1

a removed event...

  >>> events[1].oldParent == folder1
  True
  >>> events[1].newParent

and a moved event:

  >>> events[2].object == foo
  True
  >>> events[2].oldParent == folder1
  True
  >>> events[2].newParent == folder2
  True
  >>> events[2].oldName
  'foo'
  >>> events[2].newName
  'foo'

Now clean up:

  >>> folder.manage_delObjects(['folder1'])
  >>> folder.manage_delObjects(['folder2'])
  >>> clearEvents()


Copied event
------------

  >>> manage_addSimpleContent(folder, 'foo', 'Foo')
  >>> manage_addNoVerifyPasteFolder(folder, 'folder1')
  >>> folder1 = folder.folder1

We need to trigger subtransaction before copy/paste can work

  >>> transaction.commit(1)
  >>> cb = folder.manage_copyObjects(['foo'])
  >>> info = folder1.manage_pasteObjects(cb)
  >>> foo = folder1.foo

Apart from the added event we triggerred when we added the stub object
to the folder, we expect two events...

  >>> events = getEvents()
  >>> len(events)
  3

a copied event...

  >>> events[1].object == foo
  True

and an added event:

  >>> events[2].object == foo
  True
  >>> events[2].newParent == folder1
  True
  >>> events[2].newName
  'foo'

Now clean up:

  >>> folder.manage_delObjects(['folder1'])
  >>> folder.manage_delObjects(['foo'])
  >>> clearEvents()


Removed event
-------------

  >>> manage_addSimpleContent(folder, 'foo', 'Foo')
  >>> folder.manage_delObjects(['foo'])

  >>> events = getEvents()
  >>> len(events)
  2

  >>> events[1].object.id
  'foo'

  >>> clearEvents()
