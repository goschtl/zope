Five Changes
============

Five 0.2 (in development)
-------------------------

* Added utility module, 'bridge', allowing reuse of Zope 2 interfaces
  (by introspecting them to create equivalent Zope 3 interfaces).

* five:viewable was renamed to five:traversable, five:viewable still
  works but is deprecated; a deprecation warning is emitted when it is
  used.

* like in Zope3, an ITraverser adapter is looked up to determine what
  happens when traversing into a Five traversable object.

* added five:defaultViewable to make instances of a class directly
  viewable using browser:defaultView. This is hookable by the use of a
  IBrowserDefault adapter

* deprecated use of Products.Five.api as public API for other products
  to use, instead import directly from Products.Five. Retired
  Traversable and Viewable from the public API; use ZCML directives
  (five:traversable, five:defaultView) instead of mixins to make
  instances of classes work with Five.

* classes that Five monkeypatches now have a __five_method__
  attribute, making it easier for Five not to stomp on existing methods.

* registered absolute_url view and IAbsoluteURL adapter for *

* zope.app.traversing is registered by default, to make special
  namespaces available (eg: @@, ++resource++)

* we now have resources (FileResource, ImageResource,
  PageTemplateResource) and directory resources.

* Zope 3 'StandardMacros' now works with Five as well.

* browser:page now correctly handles the allow_attributes and protects
  the named attributes on the view with the same permission used for
  the view.

* zopeconf.py will try to find etc/zope.conf on INSTANCE_HOME. This
  requires Zope 2.7.2, as earlier Zope versions have a bug in this
  area which causes them to look in lib/python/Testing.

* Exposed the Zope 3 event system to Five. A class can be made to send
  out event notifications using the five:sendEvents directive. Events can
  be subscribed to using the subscriber directive.
