Five Changes
============

After 0.1
---------

- five:viewable has changed to five:traversable
- __bobo_traverse__ now uses an ITraverser adapter
- five monkeypatched methods now have a __five_method__ attribute,
  making it easier to not stomp on existing methods
- five:viewable now acts on __browser_default__. by default, it tries
  to return the browser:defaultView configured for an object. This is
  hookable by the use of a IBrowserDefault adapter
- registered absolute_url view and IAbsoluteURL adapter for *
- by default, OFS.SimpleItem.Item and OFS.ObjectManager.Manager are
  five:traversable
- zope.app.traversing is registered by default, to make special
  namespaces available (eg: @@, ++resource++)
- we now have resources (FileResource, ImageResource,
  PageTemplateResource) and directory resources.
- backported the 'StandardMacros' thing from zope 3
- browser:page now correctly handles the allow_attributes and protects
  the named attributes on the view with the same permission used for
  the view (this sounds a bit strange, doesn't it?)
- ViewPageTemplateFile 'modules' uses zope2 SecureModuleImporter now
  (eg: browser:page)
- zopeconf.py will try to find etc/zope.conf on INSTANCE_HOME
