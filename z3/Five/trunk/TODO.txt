v1.1
----

- more atomic tests (philikon)

- i18n, l10n (philikon, regebro)

- more tests for browser.adding (faassen?)

- more extensive testing whether event system works with things like
  Zope 2 folders etc. (faassen?)

- ensuring that the event-sending behavior is as close to Zope 3's as
  possible.  A lot of edge cases with different behavior likely
  remain, and things like IObjectModifiedEvents are not sent yet for
  folders. (faassen?)

v1.2
----

- Introduce site concept, make rendering of resource urls support
  sites.  Merge Sidnei's localsitemanager branch.

- Allow Zope2 boilerplate context.registerClass be configured through zcml

- Figure out where add-view redirects should go.

- Instructions on using add views.

- HTTP/WebDAV: support dispatching of all HTTP/WebDAV methods to HTTP
  views.  If lookup fails, fall back to methods on the object (Zope 2
  style).  Security is implied by HTTP views.

- FTP: allow manage_FTPstat, manage_FTPget, manage_FTPlist to dispatch to
  filerepresentation adapters.  Make sure to handle security correctly.

- Icons through <browser:icon>?

- Grant security stuff through ZCML (<grant />)?

- top-level <require />, <allow /> directives as a ZCML spelling of
  allowModule, allowClass

- zope2.Public doesn't work in browser:page (at least in functionaldoctestsuite)
