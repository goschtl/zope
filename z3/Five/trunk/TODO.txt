v1.2
----

* cleanup: reset cleanup lists

* five:registerClass (yuppie)

  - scope should probably be a Choice; default should naybe be None?

  - cleanup can be an elegant list comprehension

  - test the clean up in the doctest (see if it really cleans up)

  - 'product': class_.__module__.split('.')[1] could throw a key error...?

  - functional test that checks the ZMI if there really is an entry in
    the add menu?

* marker utility (whit, gotcha)

* make rendering of resource urls support sites?


v1.3
----

* remove certain entries from interfaces.zcml that are outdated (yuppie)

* implement an IPhysicallyLocatable adapter for Zope 2 objects, make
  OFS.Application.Application implement IContainmentRoot (in Zope 2.9)

* port to Zope 3.2 (philikon)

* test whether request with skin works properly (use ++skin++, applySkin, etc.)

* remove testrunner (philikon)

* integrate into Zope 2.9 (philikon)


v1.4
----

- l10n (philikon)

- Figure out where add-view redirects should go.

- Instructions on using add views.

- HTTP/WebDAV: support dispatching of all HTTP/WebDAV methods to HTTP
  views.  If lookup fails, fall back to methods on the object (Zope 2
  style).  Security is implied by HTTP views.

- FTP: allow manage_FTPstat, manage_FTPget, manage_FTPlist to dispatch to
  filerepresentation adapters.  Make sure to handle security correctly.

- Grant security stuff through ZCML (<grant />)?

- top-level <require />, <allow /> directives as a ZCML spelling of
  allowModule, allowClass
