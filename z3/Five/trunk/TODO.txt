----

- l10n (philikon)

- Figure out where add-view redirects should go.

- Instructions on using add views.

- HTTP/WebDAV: support dispatching of all HTTP/WebDAV methods to HTTP
  views.  If lookup fails, fall back to methods on the object (Zope 2
  style).  Security is implied by HTTP views.

- FTP: allow manage_FTPstat, manage_FTPget, manage_FTPlist to dispatch to
  filerepresentation adapters.  Make sure to handle security correctly.

- Grant security stuff through ZCML (<grant />)?

- top-level <require />, <allow /> directives as a ZCML spelling of
  allowModule, allowClass

- marker utility: re-add 'views_details' that didn't make it in 1.2/1.3
