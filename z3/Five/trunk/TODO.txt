v1.1 (mid-July)
---------------

- more atomic tests (philikon)

- more tests for browser.adding (faassen?)

- more extensive testing whether event system works with things like
  Zope 2 folders etc. (faassen?)

- ensuring that the event-sending behavior is as close to Zope 3's as
  possible.  A lot of edge cases with different behavior likely
  remain, and things like IObjectModifiedEvents are not sent yet for
  folders. (faassen?)


v2.0 (mid-August, to ship with Zope 2.9)
----------------------------------------

- Zope 3.1 support

- Drop old-style ExtensionClass support (and all other support for Zope 2.7)

- Possibly: introduce site concept, make rendering of resource urls
  support sites.  Merge Sidnei's localsitemanager branch (will
  probably have to be fixed up for component architecture refactoring
  in Zope 3.1) (sidnei)


v2.1 (...)
----------

- l10n (philikon)

- Allow Zope2 boilerplate context.registerClass be configured through zcml

- Figure out where add-view redirects should go.

- Instructions on using add views.

- HTTP/WebDAV: support dispatching of all HTTP/WebDAV methods to HTTP
  views.  If lookup fails, fall back to methods on the object (Zope 2
  style).  Security is implied by HTTP views.

- FTP: allow manage_FTPstat, manage_FTPget, manage_FTPlist to dispatch to
  filerepresentation adapters.  Make sure to handle security correctly.

- Icons through <browser:icon>?

- Grant security stuff through ZCML (<grant />)?

- top-level <require />, <allow /> directives as a ZCML spelling of
  allowModule, allowClass
