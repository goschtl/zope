- more extensive testing whether event system works with things like Zope 2 
  folders etc 

- ensuring that the event-sending behavior is as close to Zope 3's as 
  possible. A lot of edge cases with different behavior likely remain, 
  and things like IObjectModifiedEvents are not sent yet for folders.

- allow the use of five:traversable and five:defaultViewable more
  than once, to avoid conflicts between multiple Five-using products.
  We thought we had this for five:viewable (now five:traversable), but
  we left the discriminators in. This needs to be reviewed for the new 
  directives. (Similarly five:sendEvents is also a candidate for this
  treatment; should already be partially implemented correctly to allow
  multiple use as well)
  
- allow Zope2 boilerplate context.registerClass be configured thru zcml

- now that we have zope:content, do we still need five:implements?
