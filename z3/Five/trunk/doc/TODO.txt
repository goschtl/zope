- more extensive testing whether event system works with things like Zope 2 
  folders etc 

- ensuring that the event-sending behavior is as close to Zope 3's as 
  possible. A lot of edge cases with different behavior likely remain, 
  and things like IObjectModifiedEvents are not sent yet for folders.

- allow Zope2 boilerplate context.registerClass be configured thru zcml

- now that we have zope:content, do we still need five:implements?
