- make five:viewable support being called several times

- allow Zope2 boilerplate context.registerClass be configured thru zcml

- implement/register missing zope.app directives:

  * browser:defaultView (need extra machinery in Viewable)

  * ...

- support existing __bobo_traverse__ methods

- secure page templates

- now that we have zope:content, do we still need five:implements?
