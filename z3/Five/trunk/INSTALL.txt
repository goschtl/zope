How to install Five
-------------------

Requirements for Five 0.2
=========================

* Zope 2.7.2+ with python 2.3.x. Zope versions lower than Zope 2.7.2
  may work, but the tests don't run, so no guarantees.

* Zope X3.0.0, found here: http://zope.org/Products/ZopeX3/3.0.0final/

Installing Five
===============

Installing Five is relatively straightforward. 

* Select a Zope 2.7 instance.

* Download and install Zope X3.0.0. You can get it compiled and
  installed by:

    * Typing ``configure``. When you're experimenting, typically you
      want to use the ``--prefix`` directive to install the binaries
      to install it somewhere in your homedirectory.

    * ``make``
  
    * ``make install``

  On windows you can install choose to use the binary release instead.

  Alternatively you can check out the latest subversion version of
  Zope X3.0 and typing ``make`` to produce it in-place.

* You need to make your Zope 2.7 instance aware of Zope 3 so it can
  import packages from it. To do this, go to the etc/zope.conf of your
  Zope 2.7 instance and add a ``path`` entry. If you used the released
  version of Zope X3.0.0, use something like the following::

    path /path/to/installed/Zope3/lib/python

  If you are instead using the subversion version, use::

    path /path/to/Zope3/src

* Next, install the Five product into your Zope 2.7 instance as a
  product and restart Zope. Five should now be installed.

* You can also install various products in the ``demo`` subdirectory of
  Five by copying them into your ``Products`` directory.

Installing the tests
====================

For information on how to install the automatic Five tests, please see
