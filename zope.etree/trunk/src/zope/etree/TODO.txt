+ add comments into this interface.

+ extend this interface to each of the different element tree engines. So
  some example lxml supports things that the original elementtree
  implementation did and vice versa. This way developers can say give me
  an elementtree implementation support feature X. But we still need to be
  carefull that we still have a common base interface from which to work
  off.

+ Figure out how to use Python eggs for installation.

+ Is it possible to configure which zope.etree-configure.zcml to use when
  running the unit tests, as otherwise people will need to make local
  modifications to their zope.etree checkout.

+ Figure if there is some ZCML magic we can use in order to register
  a module directly has a uiltity so that there can be no bugs in my proxy
  objects.
