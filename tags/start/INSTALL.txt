Zope External Editor Installation

  Installation is two-fold: 

  - Install the ExternalEditor product in Zope.

  - Install the helper application on the client(s) and configure the browser(s)

  Product Installation

    Download the archive and extract it into your Zope products directory. Then
    restart Zope. If you succeeded, you'll notice pencil icons next to the
    external editable objects in the Zope management screens.

  Helper Application Installation (Unix)

    Download the helper app archive and extract into the directory where you want
    to install it (it contains one executable Python module file). ~/bin or
    /usr/local/bin might be good choices, the latter if you want to share it
    between multiple users.

    In order to use the helper app, you must have Python and Tkinter installed.
    It has been tested using Python 2.2.1, but it should work with Python 2.0 or
    better.

    Once you have the help application installed, you need to configure your
    browser to fire it off appropriately. To do so, create an entry in the helper
    applications list for your browser(s) that associates the mime type
    "application/x-zope-edit" with the helper application.
