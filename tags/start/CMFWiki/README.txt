This is the CMFWiki product.

It contains code from the ZWiki product, but it is otherwise unrelated.

You needn't have ZWiki installed to use CMFWiki.

CMFWiki requires the Zope CMF.

To use the product, you'll need to register the CMFWikiPage and CMFWiki
types in the portal types tool.  You'll also need to add a Filesystem
Directory View to the skins tool for the skins contained within this
pacakge, and place the directory view in the skins path for the skins you're
intending to use.
