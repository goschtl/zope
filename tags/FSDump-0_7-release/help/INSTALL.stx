Installing FSDump

 1. Unpack the product into the 'Products' directory of your
    Zope INSTANCE_HOME or SOFTWARE_HOME (see Evan Simpson's
    "INSTANCE_HOME tutorial",
    http://www.zope.org/Members/4am/instancehome ).
    
 2. Restart Zope;  verify that the FSDump product is present,
    and not "broken", in your Control_Panel/Products folder.
