MEGROK.QUARRY
=============

author :: Kevin M. Smith

Grok is an rapid application development framework built on top of the enterprise 
class Zope3's component architecture. http://grok.zope.org

As of 0.9dev, Grok has no way of associating different views with different skins.
MEGROK.QUARRY is an implementation of skins, layers and template re-use. It is
useable today and based on discussions from the mailing list. It is hoped these 
new directives and grokkers will be considered for inclusion in the core one day.

Change Log
----------

* 0.1 initial checkin

Current Enhancements
--------------------

* quarry.template directive enhancement

* quarry.View (a skin-aware version of grok.View)

* quarry.layer directive

* quarry.Layer grokker

* quarry.Skin grokker

* quarry.ViewletManager, quarry.Viewlet (based Lennart Regebro's megrok.viewlet)

* quarry.viewletmanager directive


Template Sharing and Reuse
--------------------------

Currently only inline pagetemplates are accessible via grok.template.

	  >>> class Painting(grok.View):
	  ...     grok.template('cavepainting')

	  >>> cavepainting = grok.PageTemplate("""
	  ... <html><body><h1>GROK PAINT MAMMOTH!</h1></body</html>
	  ... """)

This works fine, but you can only access templates located in the same 
module, which limits template re-use.

Using quarry.template, any template from any module may be accessed. Note,
grok.View needs to be replaced with quarry.View, since grok.View has no notion
of quarry.template.

	   >>> class Painting(quarry.View):
	   ...    quarry.template('myproject.shared.cavepainting')

myproject/shared.py

	  >>> cavepainting = grok.PageTemplate("""
	  ... <html><body><h1>GROK PAINT MAMMOTH!</h1></body</html>
	  ... """)

Also works with grok.PageTemplateFile

	  >>> cavepainting = grok.PageTemplateFile(os.path.join('shared', 
	  ...                             'cavepainting.pt'))

And plain strings
   
	  >>> cavepainting = """
	  ... <html><body><h1>GROK PAINT MAMMOTH!</h1></body</html>
	  ... """

Even docstrings

	 >>> class Painting(quarry.View):
	 ...     """<html><body><h1>GROK PAINT MAMMOTH!</h1></body</html>
	 ...     """
	 ...     quarry.template('myproject.app.Painting.__doc__')


Skins, layers and grok, oh my!
------------------------------

Megrok.quarry implements the notion of skin and layers. The quarry.View
grokker recognizes the quarry.layer directive. This directive is both a 
module level and class level driective.
	
First let us define an admin skin, and a public skin.

	>>> class AdminLayer(quarry.Layer, IDebugLayer):
	...     pass

	>>> class Admin(quarry.Skin):
	...     grok.name('admin') # default, accessible as ++skin++admin
	...     quarry.layer(AdminLayer)

	>>> class PublicLayer(quarry.Layer):
	...     pass

	>>> class Public(quarry.Skin):
	...    grok.name('public') # default name, accessible as ++skin++public
	...    quarry.layer(PublicLayer) # must pass interface     

In our app, we associate layers to views as follows

       >>> from skin import AdminLayer

       >>> class AdminPanel(quarry.View):
       ...     quarry.layer(AdminLayer)

Or we can associate layers at a module level

      >>> quarry.layer(PublicLayer)

      >>> class MyPublicView(quarry.View):
      ...     # defaults to PublicLayer

      
Viewlets
--------

Both quarry.ViewletManager and quarry.Viewlet are base on Lennart Regebro's
megrok.viewlet. 

In this version both quarry.Viewlet and quarry.ViewletManager have been 
fashioned to be more grok.View-like. This means you can use quarry.template,
view.url(), static, and any  other methods you might find on a regular view.

Also the quarry.viewletmanager directive has been added to associate viewlet
with viewletmanager.

     >>> from megrok import quarry

     >>> class MyView(quarry.View):
     ...    quarry.template('myproject.app.MyView.__doc__')

     >>> myview_template = qrok.PageTemplateFile(os.path.join('myview.pt'))

Due to a limitation or a bug in grok.PageTemplate, the talnamespace 'provider' 
is only available to templates accessed as grok.PageTemplateFile.

myview.pt

     <html metal:use-macro="context/@@public/page">
     <body>
     <metal:block fill-slot="pagecontent">
     <span tal:replace="structure provider:body" />
     </metal:block>
     </body></html>


     >>> class MenuManager(quarry.ViewletManager):
     ...    grok.context(MyView) # associate viewletmanager with a view
     ...    grok.name('body') #fill tal-namespace 'provide:body'
     
     >>> class Menu10(quarry.Viewlet):
     ...    quarry.viewletmanager(MenuManager)
     ...    def render(self):
     ...        return "Fish Tacos"

     >>> class Menu20(quarry.Viewlet):
     ...    quarry.viewletmanager(MenuManager)	
     ...    def render(self)l
     ...        return "Buffalo Wings"

     >>> class Menu30(quarry.Viewlet):
     ...    """<i>Side of Blue Cheese </i>"""
     ...    quarry.viewletmanager(MenuManager)
     ...    quary.template('myproject.app.Menu30.__doc__')

The quarry.ViewletManager automatically sorts by viewlet class name. So
Menu10 appears first and Menu30 appears last.


install
-------

* checkout via subversion
* add megrok.quarry-meta to zcml of buildout instance


Todo
----

* better documentation
* quarry.TALNamespace
* tests, tests, tests, currently they are intertwined in a seperate project
* currently grok.Layer inherits from IDefaultBrowserLayer, don't do this


Thank You

The Grok team lead by Martijn and Philipp and Zope3 community for making web programming
entirely too much fun.  :)
