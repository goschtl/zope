3.5.1 (unreleased)
------------------

- Make security protection directives in `configure.zcml` execute only
  if ``zope.security`` is installed. This will allow reuse of the
  `configure.zcml` file in environments without ``zope.security``,
  for example with ``repoze.zcml``.

- Add "Password Manager Names" vocabulary for use with ``zope.schema``
  and ``zope.component``. This change doesn't add depdendency on them,
  because it's an optional feature and one who want to use that vocabulary
  is probably already have them installed.

3.5.0 (2009-03-06)
------------------

First release. This package was splitted off from ``zope.app.authentication``
to separate password manager functionality that is greatly re-usable without
any bit of ``zope.app.authentication`` and to reduce its dependencies.
