Hotfix-20060705 README
======================

This hotfix corrects an information disclosure vulnerability in Zope2, due to Zope2's
use of the docutils module to parse and rend "restructured text".

Sites which allow untrusted users to create restructured text as through-the-web
content should upgrade to a version of Zope2 more recent than this hotfix.

Affected Versions
-----------------

  - Zope 2.7.0 - 2.7.8

  - Zope 2.8.0 - 2.8.7

  - Zope 2.9.0 - 2.9.2
