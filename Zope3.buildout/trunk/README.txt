===============
Zope 3 buildout
===============

This is a (currently experimental) version of the Zope 3 trunk that assembles
the same application as Zope 3 using a buildout and eggs. It might, in the
future, replace the current Zope 3 application/release/distribution.

Todo
----

- Get the same application working as with the current Zope 3 trunk

- Provide a migration script for existing Zope 3 (3.3) instances
