================================================
SWFObject as library as Resource
================================================

This package registers the SWFObject Javascript Flash Player detection
and embed script javascript library as a browser resourcedirectory
called ``swfobject``.

Additionally if zc.resourcelibrary is installed it also registers a
resourcelibrary called 'z3c.javascript.swfobject'. This
resourcelibrary includes only scriptaculous.js directly.

See: http://script.aculo.us/

This javascript library requires the prototype library which is
provided by the ``z3c.javascript.prototype```package
