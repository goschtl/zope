================================================
 Script.aculo.us Javascript library as Resource
================================================

This package registers the script.aculo.us javascript library as a
browser resourcedirectory called `scriptaculous`.

Additionally if zc.resourcelibrary is installed it also registers a
resourcelibrary called 'z3c.javascript.scriptaculous'. This
resourcelibrary includes only scriptaculous.js directly.

See: http://script.aculo.us/

This javascript library requires the prototype library which is
provided by the ``z3c.javascript.prototype```package
