Changes
=======

2.0 (2009-04-30)
----------------

- FEATURE: Store your template files in a separate directory structure, using
  the ``source-directory`` option.

- FEATURE: Specify multiple files automatically with globs.

- FEATURE: Templates can reference other buildout sections using the usual
  syntax, e.g. ${buildout:parts}

- FEATURE: Share options with other sections using the typical ``extends``
  option.

- FEATURE: Create destination directories automatically.

- FEATURE: Define option values for templates dynamically in Python with the
  ``interpreted-options`` option.

- FEATURE: Get paths for eggs by specifying ``eggs`` and ``extra-paths``, just
  like zc.recipe.egg script recipe.  These are available in template options
  in colon-delimited, space-delimited, and quoted variants.  You can also build
  your own using the ``interpreted-options`` feature.

- BUGFIX: templates are not processed if there are no changes to them or the
  buildout.
