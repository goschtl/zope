2.1.0 (Unreleased)
==================

--------
Features
--------

- Support the new zc.buildout 1.4.0+ include-site-packages option.

- Use the new zc.buildout 1.4.0+ path sorting algorithm, which puts
  site-package dependency paths after the other dependency paths (but before
  extra paths, as before).  This can reduce or eliminate problems with
  packages in site-packages causing other dependencies to be masked with the
  versions in site-packages.

- Support escaping "$" with "$$" in templates.  This is particularly useful
  for *NIX shell scripts.

- Support specifying local options in templates without braces (e.g.,
  "Hello $world" is now equivalent to "Hello ${world}".

-----
Fixes
-----

- Clarify that the recipe does not support the relative-paths options.

- Make tests less susceptible to timing errors.


2.0.3 (2009-07-02)
==================

-----
Fixes
-----

- Use ``realpath`` helper function from zc.buildout on the buildout
  directory too, such that it goes through the same normalization as
  the path being compared and stands a chance of working on Windows,
  due to possible drive letter case differences.

2.0.2 (2009-05-04)
==================

-----
Fixes
-----

- Turns out sorting paths was a bad idea.  They are already in a deterministic
  order, AFAICT, because of the order or processing dependencies.  Sorting
  them makes them *less* deterministic in practice, across machines.

2.0.1 (2009-04-30)
==================

-----
Fixes
-----

- Correct sdist generation to include all necessary files.

- Doc formatting fixes.

- Correct "Destinations already exist" message to list destinations without
  ``.in`` suffix.

2.0 (2009-04-30)
================

--------
Features
--------

- Store your template files in a separate directory structure, using the
  ``source-directory`` option.

- Specify multiple files automatically with globs.

- Templates can reference other buildout sections using the usual syntax, e.g.
  ${buildout:parts}

- Share options with other sections using the typical ``extends`` option.

- Create destination directories automatically.

- Define option values for templates dynamically in Python with the
  ``interpreted-options`` option.

- Get paths for eggs by specifying ``eggs`` and ``extra-paths``, just like
  zc.recipe.egg script recipe.  These are available in template options in
  colon-delimited, space-delimited, and quoted variants.  You can also build
  your own using the ``interpreted-options`` feature.

- Templates are not processed if there are no changes to them or the buildout.

1.0 (2007-09-30)
================

Initial release.
