			<h3>Questions and Answers</h3>
			<p>Will the repository present a full-functioning application, like a
				CMS?</p>
			<p>No, the purpose of the repository is to be a <em>collection of
				components</em> that is useful for a wider variety of applications.
				Applications should be developed, maintained and governed outside this
				repository. For example, Plone is developed by the Plone Foundation on
				plone.org and the Tiks CMS by Projekt01 on tiks.org. However, those
				applications may apply for certification.</p>
