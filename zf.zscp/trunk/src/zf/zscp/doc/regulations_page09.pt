		<h3 class="itemNine itemHeading">Questions and Answers</h3>
		<p>Does this proposal imply that all certified packages <em>must</em> live in the
			Common Repository?</p>
		<p>No, absolutely not! The ZSCP is completely disconnected from the Common
			Repository. The common repsoitory is merely a place where it will be easy for
			packages to undergo certification, since it will provide the necessary tools to
			automatically check for the fullfillment of the requirements.</p>
		<p>Why would you want your package in the Common Repository?</p>
		<p>Placing your package in the Common Repository (like the collective in other
			communities) will ensure a certain exposure of the code to others. If your
			package will be certified, then other people will dedicate time to keep up the
			compatibility and quality of the package. Further, you can use the
			certification as a way to market your software and your skills. It is also
			<em>your</em> personal way you can contribute back to the community.</p>
		<p>Is the proposal too formal? Is the entry bar too high?</p>
		<p>Some people might argue that the process is too formal and that the demotion clause
			for certified packages will cause no packages being certified. I do not think
			that will be the case. There will always be a set of packages that many people will
			rely on (such as RDB adapters, LDAP adapter, authentication plugins) and where
			the community has a vested interest in maintaining them. Also, I think there is a
			general desire in the wider Zope community to have quality packages; this
			proposal provides a roadmap for developers to produce those high-quality
			packages.</p>
		<p>How does this fit into the Cubed effort?</p>
		<p>First a definition of &quot;Cubed&quot;: Cubed is an effort by the Plone
			developers to develop generic Zope 3 components that are primarily applicable
			to Plone (integrated via Five for now), but are also usable by a wider audience.
			The ultimate goal is to eventually provide a migration path of Plone from the Zope
			2 to the Zope 3 platform.</p>
		
		<p>Will the Zope Foundation and/or the Zope core developers have the bandwidth to
			process certification requests in a timely manner?</p>
		<p>One big goal of the quality metrics section is to identify a set of quantifiable
			items that can be easily verified using an automated process. Thus the overhead
			for the core developers should be minimized. Also, an efficient Web site for the
			process should allow certification managers to quickly provide the
			certification. Overall, certifying a package should become as common of a task
			as making releases or even writing documentation.</p>
		<p>For such a process it seems to be useful to have an issue tracker, special mailing
			lists and/or an advanced buildbot setup. Why are those technologies not
			addressed in the proposal?</p>
		<p>This proposal is <em>not</em> about technical solutions. It is about defining a
			process and laying the implementation of this process via a community
			repository. The purpose of the proposal is to establish an initial set of
			guidelines/rules and not to discuss the technical implementation.</p>
		<p>Why are dependencies not addressed in more detail?</p>
		<p>Currently, we simply do not have any system in place that could sensibly handle
			version requirements. However, several systems are currently being built. The
			goal of this proposal is not to invent yet another version dependency system.
			Thus the issue is deferred until the Zope community decides on a system to
			use.</p>
		<p>Are we going to certify core packages that are also seperate projects?</p>
		<p>Yes, I imagine that it will be generally easier to certify those packages. Also,
			having them certified separately makes it easier to amrket their
			certification.</p>
