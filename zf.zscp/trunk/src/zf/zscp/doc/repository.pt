		<p>This section describes <em>one</em> open community-repository that
			implements the ZSCP process.</p>
		<h3 class="itemOne itemHeading">Definition</h3>
		<p>The Common Repository is a Zope Foundation SVN repository for third-party Zope
			packages, which are useful for a wide variety of applications, but that do not fit
			into the Zope core distribution. Common examples for those packages include
			advanced Javascript-based widgets, alternative templating systems,
			specific content types, etc.</p>
		<p>The existing <tt class="docutils literal">
			<span class="pre">svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main</span></tt> will serve
			as the Common Repository. Every package in the common repository <em>must</em>
			conform at least to the layout as described in section 3.2. If a package wishes to
			participate in the ZSCP, then it must also conform to the program's process. The
			implementation details of the ZSCP process are provided in the sections
			below.</p>
		<p>The Common Repository is only <em>one</em> implementation of the ZSCP. While the
			Common Repository implements the ZSCP guidelines and suggested automation
			tools, the ZSCP process itself does <em>not</em> require the Common
			Repository.</p>
		<p>Unless otherwise stated, certified packages will automatically be released
			with every new Zope release. This, on the other hand, will greatly simplify the
			dependency tree for Common Repository based packages.</p>
