			<p>The main purpose of this section is to define the workflow that a package
				undergoes to change its certification level within the ZSCP. A secondary
				goal is to provide a roadmap for packages to move upstream into the Zope or
				even Python core, if applicable. With this in mind, it should be easy for the
				Zope users to find and discover packages, including their meta,
				certification and release data. Also, receiving a certification level
				should be perceived as reward for the hard work being done; an
				accomplishment the package authors should be proud of and be able to market
				it accordingly.</p>
			<p>The certification process is conducted by the Zope Foundation with the tight
				collaboration of the &quot;core developers&quot;. For lack of any other
				definition, core developers are defined as developers regularly
				contributing to the Zope core components. They are often informally
				identified by the community. The developers conducting the
				certifications are known as the <em>certification managers</em>.</p>
			<p>As defined in section 2.3., the ZSCP defines four distinct package
				certification levels. Achieving the first status of being a listed package
				is an automated process. Once the authors fulfill the package layout
				guidelines, have provided all required package meta-data and are hooked
				into the automated test runner, then listed package status will be granted
				to them from the system.</p>
			<p>For the other three certification levels, a certification manager
				<em>must</em> grant the certification level. The authors of a package have
				to demonstrate that they have fulfilled the requirements for the desired
				level. The fulfillment of the requirements is checked automatically via
				some tools, like the automated test runner and coverage checker, and by
				inspection of the certification manager.</p>
			<p>Both, the requirements and process, are developed in a way that it should be
				also simple and fast to receive certification level 1 and level 2. The
				turn-around time of a request for being granted a certification level 1 or
				level 2 should be about 1 day.</p>
			<p>The certification of level 3 will usually take some more time, since it
				requires the certification manager to inspect the code in much more detail.
				However, the certification time should not exceed a couple of weeks.</p>
			<p>Overall, it is very important for the process to have as little overhead as
				possible and make the certification process a quick, easy and fun
				experience.</p>
			<p>When packages are not maintained anymore, they may lose their
				certification. If a package is not updated for a given Zope release cycle
				once, it receives a warning. If the package is not updated for a second
				release cycle in a row, it will lose its certification and will be demoted to
				the next appropriate level. This will commonly mean that it becomes a
				&quot;listed&quot; package again. The exception is, of course, when a
				package has no changes since the last version. In those cases it is simply
				enough to verify that the package still works and to make an entry in the <tt
					class="docutils literal">
				<span class="pre">CHANGES.txt</span></tt> file to that effect.</p>
			<p>When any of the requirements listed in this document change, then the
				packages have one release cycle to upgrade to the new requirements. After
				one release cycle, the package receives a warning. If the requirements are
				not upgraded for another release cycle, the package will loose its
				certification and will be demoted to the next appropriate level.</p>
			<p>While certified packages have to fulfill the requirements of the quality
				metrics, in return there will also be some technical benefits. Packages
				that are part of the ZSCP will be automatically tested, have coverage
				reports created, and be listed on the ZSCP Web site.</p>
			<p>There is <em>no</em> fee associated with the certification. One of the goals
				of the program is to encourage developers to write better code and provide
				them with ways to measure it. The certification is a way of saying
				&quot;thank you&quot;. And for the community it is overall better to have as
				many certified packages as possible.</p>
