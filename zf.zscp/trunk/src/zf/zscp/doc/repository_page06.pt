			<p>By default, packages in the Common Repository will adopt the same release
				schedule as Zope. The Zope development team releases two major releases a
				year, one in May and one in November.</p>
			<p>A positive side effect of this rule is that the dependencies on Common
				Repository packages should be pretty simple. This model has worked great
				for the KDE community, which always distributes a large set of their
				libraries and programs at the same time.</p>
			<p>However, packages may also choose their own release schedule. In this case
				dependencies must be carefully stated in the release data file.</p>
