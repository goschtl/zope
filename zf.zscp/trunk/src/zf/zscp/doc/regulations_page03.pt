			<h3 class="itemThree itemHeading">Certification Levels</h3>
			
			<p>There are 4 distinct levels for certification. They are defined in the list
				below. The specific list of quality requirements for each level is provided
				in <a href="@@regulations_page04.html">section 4</a>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h4>ZSCP Listed</h4>
					<p>Getting a package listed in the ZSCP system is the first step to
						obtain certification. Packages listed on the ZSCP Web site must
						adhere to the common package layout[1] and are subject to the
						automated testing as well as the quality assurance process.
						Listed packages must provide a full set of meta-data (as
						applicable) as defined in <a
							href="@@regulations_page05.html">section 5</a>.</p>
					<p>Packages at this level will fulfill roughly the same purpose as
						packages in the CMF/Plone Collective. It is one way to make a
						package publicly available and give it some exposure. At this
						level, the developer will not have to comply with many of the
						quality metrics. See <a href="@@regulations_page04.html">
						section 4</a>.</p>
					
					<p>[1] The common package layout is defined in <a
							href="@@repository_page02.html"> section 2</a> of the
						Repository Layout.</p>
					
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>ZSCP Level 1 Certified</h4>
					<p>To be level 1 certified, the package must fulfill the requirements
						of listed packages. Additionally, it has to provide
						documentation, tests (in doctest format), conform to the package
						and coding style guidelines, and provide migration scripts, if
						applicable.</p>
					<p>At this level, packages are considered fit for the Zope 3 core. The
						core developers reserve the right to provide or require small
						improvements.</p>
					<p>At this stage one may identify the package as &quot;ZSCP Level 1
						Certified&quot; in informal or promotional material.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>ZSCP Level 2 Certified</h4>
					<p>To be level 2 certified, the package must fulfill the requirements
						of level 1 certified packages. Additionally, it has to be
						demonstrated that the package integrates well into the Zope
						software stack by providing documentation in alternative
						sources (Web sites/API doc), provide standard installation
						methods and demonstrate the correct functioning of the migration
						scripts.</p>
					<p>At this stage one may identify the package as &quot;ZSCP Level 2
						Certified&quot; in informal or promotional material.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>ZSCP Level 3 Certified</h4>
					<p>To be level 3 certified, the package must fulfill the requirements
						of level 2 certified packages. Additionally, it has to be
						demonstrated that the package has been successfully released
						during several Zope release cycles, has an active development
						community and an up-to-date support structure and
						resources.</p>
					<p>At this stage one may identify the package as &quot;ZSCP Level 3
						Certified&quot; in informal or promotional material.</p>
