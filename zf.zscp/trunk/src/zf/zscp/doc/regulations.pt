			<p>This section describes the process for Zope-related software to receive
				quality certification.</p>
			
			<p>Historically, the Zope community had no development process. This was in
				part because the development of Zope 2 was controlled by Digital Creations
				(now Zope Corporation) and testing-automation tools were not available at
				that time. Also, Zope 2 lacked the necessary documentation. All this lead to
				an accepted misuse of the API and often low quality software.</p>
			<p>With the advent of Zope 3, procedures were set in place to ensure the quality
				and documentation of the code. Guided by eXtreme Programming practices,
				sprints were organized to educate the Zope community about the project and
				have high-productivity development time, proposals were introduced to
				ensure the proper discussion of a feature before implementation, and tests
				were required to ensure the overall quality of the code base. This
				development process is called the Zope Community Process.</p>
			<p>While the Zope Community Process provides an excellent method for
				developing community-driven projects like Zope 3, it (a) does not show how
				to produce simple high-quality packages, (b) measure the quality, and (c)
				communicate the state of a package to outsiders. The goal of the Zope
				Software Certification Program (ZSCP) is (a) to clearly define the levels
				of software quality using a metric system and (b) to communicate this
				information to our users, customers, and prospective customers.</p>
