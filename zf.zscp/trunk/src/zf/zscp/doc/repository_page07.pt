			<h3 class="itemSeven itemHeading">License</h3>
			<p>The license of the repository is probably the most sensitive issue. The Plone
				community has stated several times the need to protect their core values
				using the GPL. However, in order to maximize cooperation with other
				projects, the Plone community also agrees to develop generic packages
				under different licenses. Other parties usually use the ZPL or a BSD-like
				license.</p>
			<p>Thus it is proposed to place all the packages in the Zope 3 Common Repository
				under the ZPL.</p>
			<p>There has been an alternative argument and proposal concerning licenses.
				One of the goals of Zope 3 is to become a better citizen of the Python
				community, in other words, Zope wants to be more Pythonic. From a Python
				developer's point of view, the ZPL is yet another reminder that Zope has
				special rules. It has thus been proposed to use the Python license.</p>
			<p>Another issue that has surfaced frequently in the past was the inclusion of
				third-party software; this especially applies to Javascript libraries.
				If a third-party software is included in the repository as part of a package,
				the package <em>must</em> contain a <tt class="docutils literal">
				<span class="pre">LICENSES.txt</span></tt> file that lists all the
				applicable licenses with a reference to the code they apply to. The release
				manager and/or a member of the &quot;checkin police&quot; (to be
				determined) <em>must</em> be notified of such inclusion, so that the
				references can be verified. Failure to do so can result in loss of checkin
				privileges and/or removal of the package. While this policy might sound
				very demanding at first sight, it is simply a necessary measure to protect
				the Zope community legally.</p>
