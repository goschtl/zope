			<h3 class="itemTwo itemHeading">Audience</h3>
			
			<p>The audience for the Zope Software Certification Program (ZSCP) is
				two-fold. On the one hand, it is desired to provide the developer with an
				overview of quality packages, on the other hand, decision makers need to be
				shown how seriously the Zope community takes the assurance of software
				quality.</p>
			<p>One common complain the Zope developers received from the Zope community was
				about the non-existent organization of Zope's third party products.
				Everybody can upload their product to zope.org, without any evaluation of
				quality, version compatibility or documentation. The goal of the ZSCP and
				its Web site is to provide a measurement of quality 
				(<a href="@@regulations_page04.html">see section 4</a>)
				measured as much as possible by automated tools and by minimal developer
				verification. Also, packages listed in the ZSCP <em>must</em> provide a
				set of meta-data that links the user to various online resources. 
				(<a href="@@regulations_page05.html">see section 5</a>)</p>
			<p>The message to the decision maker varies slightly based on his/her
				familiarity with Open Source and Zope in particular. To the uninitiated
				decision maker the ZSCP should send a message of technical and economic
				professionalism. The ZSCP is a viable resource to understand the software
				quality requirements and the process that enforces this quality. For more
				technically versed people, it also provides a great overview of available
				features through add-on packages. For the uninitiated decision maker it is
				also very important to know that the Zope Foundation, a
				company-independent institution, fully supports this program and its
				process.</p>
			<p>The initiated decision maker already believes in Open Source and Zope, but
				might be skeptical about other third-party packages. For him/her, the ZSCP
				provides not only a searchable list of quality packages, but also
				guidelines of what to expect of his/her developers in terms of software
				quality. Again, the support of the Zope Foundation is reassuring to him that
				the program is legitimate.</p>
