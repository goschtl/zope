			<p>Packages in the Common Repository <em>must</em> have the following
				layout:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<dl>
					<dt>repos/main/&lt;NAMESPACE&gt;.&lt;PACKAGE&gt;</dt>
					<dd>branches/</dd>
					<dd>tags/</dd>
					<dd>trunk/</dd>
					<dd>
						<dl>
							<dt>... setup files ...</dt>
							<dd>src/</dd>
						</dl>
						<dl>
									<dt>&lt;NAMESPACE&gt;/</dt>
									<dd>
										<dl>
											<dt>&lt;PACKAGE&gt;/</dt>
											<dd>... code ...</dd>
										</dl>
									</dd>
						</dl>
						<dl>
							<dt>zscp/ [optional]</dt>
							<dd>ZSCP.cfg</dd>
							<dd>PUBLICATION.cfg [optional]</dd>
							<dd>CERTIFICATIONS.xml [optional]</dd>
							<dd>RELEASES.xml [optional]</dd>
						</dl>
					</dd>
				</dl>
			</blockquote>
			<p>This layout, with exception of the <tt class="docutils literal">
				<span class="pre">zscp/</span></tt> directory, follows the common
				layout guidelines of SVN and Python. The optional <tt
					class="docutils literal">
				<span class="pre">zscp/</span></tt> directory contains all the
				information to satisfy the ZSCP's package data requirements. The key file
				is <tt class="docutils literal">
				<span class="pre">ZSCP.cfg</span></tt>, which contains a reference to
				other files containing the necessary data.</p>
			<p>The format of the <tt class="docutils literal">
				<span class="pre">ZSCP.cfg</span></tt> file is as follows:</p>
			<pre class="literal-block">			
			publication &lt;PATH-OR-URL-TO-PUBLICATION-FILE&gt;
			certifications &lt;PATH-OR-URL-TO-CERTIFICATIONS-FILE&gt;
			releases &lt;PATH-OR-URL-TO-RELEASES-FILE&gt;
			</pre>
			<p>The value for each field, <tt class="docutils literal">
				<span class="pre">publication</span></tt>, <tt
					class="docutils literal">
				<span class="pre">certifications</span></tt>, and <tt
					class="docutils literal">
				<span class="pre">releases</span></tt> is a relative path or URL to the
				corresponding file. The formats for those files is defined in section
				3.3.</p>
			<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">
				<span class="pre">zscp/</span></tt> directory and the <tt
					class="docutils literal">
				<span class="pre">ZSCP.cfg</span></tt> file should be auto-generated
				using the ZSCP homepage. The goal of the ZSCP configuration file is to
				disconnect the concern of the package manager with that of the
				certification manager. In other words, the package manager should
				<em>never</em> be concerned with the maintenance of the of the ZSCP
				certification and data in the repository.</p>
			<p>While other repository layouts were originally considered, the layout
				above has several advantages. First of all, it keeps the hierarchy of the
				repository relatively flat; it is really just one level deep. Python
				developers tend to like that. The naming of packages as <tt
					class="docutils literal">
				<span class="pre">&lt;NAMESPACE&gt;.&lt;PACKAGE&gt;</span></tt> is
				already used in the zope.org repository now and works well.</p>
			<p>However, a package in the Common Repository is <em>not</em> required to
				apply the ZSCP process. This will allow for experimental and non-generic
				packages to reside in the Common Repository as well.</p>
			<p>Since it is not the goal of the Common Repository to assimilate all projects,
				one can choose whatever namespace desired for a package. There are a only a
				few rules:</p>
			<ol class="arabic simple">
				<li>Every package <em>must</em> be located in a namespace.</li>
				<li>Packages from the same developer/institution should have the same
					namespace. For example, Zope Corporation always uses <tt
						class="docutils literal">
					<span class="pre">zc</span></tt>.</li>
				<li>The <tt class="docutils literal">
					<span class="pre">zope</span></tt> namespace is reserved for Zope 3
					core components.</li>
				<li>The default namespace for one-time package developers to use is <tt
						class="docutils literal">
					<span class="pre">zf</span></tt> -- short for Zope
					Foundation.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The Common Repository is <em>not</em> a replacement for other high-level
				repositories like Plone's or ECM's. It does not aim at assimilating
				everything in the wider Zope community. It is merely a place for
				high-quality packages that are supported by the Zope development
				team.</p>
			<p>Code in the Common Repository <em>must</em> also use the license stated in
				section 3.5 and developers <em>must</em> sign the contributor agreement.
				The agreement is necessary to ensure that contributions originated from
				the contributing developer.</p>
			<p>A final goal of the Common Repository is to ease the upstream movement of
				packages. It should be easy to promote a package to the Zope 3 core or even to
				the Python standard library. Since all packages in the Common Repository
				have a license that can be changed by the Zope Foundation and developers have
				signed contributor agreements, packages can be easily moved into the Zope 3
				and Python core.</p>
