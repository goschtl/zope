			<h3 class="itemEight itemHeading">An Example</h3>
			<p>(informal voice)</p>
			<p>In the last weeks, I have frequently used an example to illustrate the
				process. One very common functionality that is needed for many types of Web
				applications is the &quot;search&quot;. Depending on the software stack
				one is using, the actual &quot;search&quot; implementation might be quite
				different. However, there is some value in defining a simple, but generic
				search API. Based on this API a package would provide a nice set of UI
				components that could be used by anyone implementing the search API.</p>
			<p>Since such a package (possibly including a generic sample implementation)
				would be very useful for a wide variety of people, it would be added to the
				Common Repository. After some initial setup, the package will have the
				&quot;listed&quot; ZSCP status. This should open up the visibility a lot
				and attract people from sub-communities, like Plone, tiks and Z3ECM.</p>
			<p>Since people from other Zope communities provide a very large skillset, the
				community effect is used to improve the API and some initial
				implementations are done against the API. At this stage the package would
				apply for Level 1 certification.</p>
			<p>As the API matures, specific projects like Plone would then provide specific
				implementations of this search API and maintain this code in their
				repository, since (a) the code would not be very useful for other projects
				and (b) the additional code provides specific value that can be protected.
				This process also naturally adds support and documentation to the package,
				making it possible to apply for Level 2 certification.</p>
			<p>Once the package is mature and the sub-projects have successfully deployed
				it, the package will receive the Level 3 certification. While this process
				may take a year or longer to complete, it ensures that the API of the search
				package is truly useful and provides benefit to the intended audience.</p>
