3.2.3.1 (unreleased) (TinyMCE version: 3.2.3)
=============================================

* Upgrade to TinyMCE version 3.2.3.

* Add ZCML configuration from `hurry.zopetinymce`. With Zope you can
  now use `hurry.tinymce` without additional
  `hurry.zopetinymce`. Please make sure, however, that
  `hurry.zoperesource` is available at runtime.

* Modified ``prepare.py`` to also cope with changed directory
  structure of TinyMCE 3.2.3.

3.2.0.2 (2008-10-13) (TinyMCE version: 3.2.0.2)
===============================================

* Initial public release.
