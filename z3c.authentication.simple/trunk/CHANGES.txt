0.5.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- initial release.

- removed ZMI support, there will be a ZAM plugin which allows you to manage
  the SimpleAuthentication and it's members and plugins. This means this
  implementation does not depend on a specific management framework anymore.
  Feel free to move the existing ZMi based browser views from the old 
  z3c.authentication package to a new package if you need them. Or let me
  know if I should do it for you.

  See zam.api and zamplugin.authentication for the new management interface 
  concept we offer.

- replaced zope.app.form based views with z3c.form and z3c.pagelet patterns

- remove zmi_views and zmi_actions

- moved implementation from z3c.authentication to z3c.authentication.simple
