Using a download cache
======================

Normally, when distributions are installed, if any processing is
needed, they are downloaded from the internet to a temporary directory
and then installed from there.  A download cache can be used to avoid
the download step.  This can be useful to reduce network access and to
create source distributions of an entire buildout.

The buildout download-cache option can be used to specify a directory
to be used as a download cache.

In this example, we'll create a directory to hold the cache:

    >>> cache = tmpdir('cache')

We have an archive with a demo foo tar ball:

    >>> ls(distros)
    -  foo.tgz

Let's update a sample buildout to install it:

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = foo
    ... download-cache = %s
    ... log-level = DEBUG
    ...
    ... [foo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/foo.tgz
    ... """ % (cache, distros) )

We used the url option to specify the location of the archive.

It creates a make file which is also run:

    >>> print system('bin/buildout')
    In...
    ...
    Installing foo.
    foo: Searching cache at /cache/cmmi
    foo: Did not find foo.tgz under cache key /cache/cmmi/...
    foo: Cache download /distros/foo.tgz as /cache/cmmi/...
    foo: Unpacking and configuring
    configuring foo /sample-buildout/parts/foo
    echo building foo
    building foo
    echo installing foo
    installing foo
    <BLANKLINE>

We'll also get the download cache populated.  The buildout doesn't put
files in the cache directly.  It creates an intermediate directory,
cmmi:

    >>> ls(cache)
    d  cmmi
    d  dist

The cmmi directory contains the cache keys - these are hashes of the download url

    >>> import os
    >>> cache_path = os.path.join( cache, 'cmmi' )
    >>> cache_key = os.listdir( cache_path )[0]

Each hash key contains two files, the downloaded file and a log describing the download

    >>> cache_entry = os.path.join( cache_path, cache_key )
    >>> ls(cache_entry)
    -  cache.ini
    -  foo.tgz

If we remove the installed parts and then re-run, we'll see that the
files are not downloaded afresh:

    >>> import os
    >>> for f in os.listdir( 'parts' ):
    ...     remove('parts', f)
   
    >>> print system(buildout)
    In...
    ...
    Uninstalling foo.
    Installing foo.
    foo: Searching cache at /cache/cmmi
    foo: Using cache file /cache/cmmi/...
    foo: Unpacking and configuring
    configuring foo /sample-buildout/parts/foo
    echo building foo
    building foo
    echo installing foo
    installing foo
    <BLANKLINE>

This is because the ones in the download cache are used

Installing solely from a download cache
---------------------------------------

A download cache can be used as the basis of application source
releases.  In an application source release, we want to distribute an
application that can be built without making any network accesses.  In
this case, we distribute a buildout with download cache and tell the
buildout to install from the download cache only, without making
network accesses.  The buildout install-from-cache option can be used
to signal that packages should be installed only from the download
cache.
