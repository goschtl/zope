zope.tal version 3.2.0.2 (2006/04/16)
-------------------------------------

zope.tal version 3.2.0 (2006/01/05)
-----------------------------------

- Corresponds to the verison of the zope.tal package shipped as part of

- Ensured that 'tal:content=""' got properly handled by 'i18n:translate=""'.
  See http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope3-dev/455.

- Corrected TALInterpreter methods to call its own 'translate', rather
  than invoking engine directly;  this caused 'i18nextract' to fail,
  due to mysterious lossage of file positions.
