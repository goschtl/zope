Pac: The Public Access Catalog container class
==============================================

A Pac is designed to store book records. Let's create one and put a few
books in it::

  >>> from kirbi.pac import Pac
  >>> from kirbi.book import Book
  >>> pac = Pac()
  >>> pac.addBook(Book(u'Zero'))
  >>> pac.addBook(Book(isbn13='978-0670030583'))
  >>> pac.addBook(Book(u'A Tale of Two Cities', isbn13='978-0141439600'))
  >>> sorted(pac)
  ['9780141439600', '9780670030583', 'k0001']

One of the books does has ISBN but no Title, so it's put in the fetch queue::

  >>> len(pac)
  3
