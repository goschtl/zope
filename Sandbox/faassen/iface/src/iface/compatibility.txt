Compatibility with zope.interface
=================================

The goal of iface to be behavior-compatible with zope.interface and
zope.component. We also intend to eventually provide support for
zope.interface. We test the backwards compatibility here. The idea is
that this test is run twice, once with the AdapterRegistry from
zope.interface, and once with the compatible
CompatibilityAdapterRegistry provided by iface.

  >>> from zope.interface import Interface
  >>> class IA(Interface):
  ...     pass
  >>> class IB(IA):
  ...     pass
  >>> class IC(IA):
  ...     pass
  >>> class ID(IB, IC):
  ...      pass
  >>> class ILookup(Interface):
  ...      "A simple interface to look up"

  >>> reg = AdapterRegistry()
  >>> reg.register((IA,), ILookup, '', u'Value for A')
  >>> reg.lookup((IA,), ILookup)
  u'Value for A'
