ZooKeeper Python bindings
=========================

This is a self-contained distribution of the ZooKeeper Python
bindings. It should build on any unix-like system by just running the
setuposcript or using an install tool like pip, easy_install or
buildout. (Windows patches to the setup script are welcomne. :)

For more information **except** building instructions, see the file
ORIGINAL-README included in the source distribution.
