Introduction
============

Jsonform (zc.jsonform) is a framework for automating ajax-based form
processing.  Forms are a common tool for collecting and displaying
data. They're most appropriate for managing data corresponding to
database records or flat object state.  Typically a form has a UI
consisting of a single page (or dialog) with a fixed bumer of fields
of various types.  Even within a more complex data structure, like a
tree or a table, forms may be used to work with portions of the larger
data structure.

The Jsonform framework [#whyframework]_ provides:

- Client-side and server-side form validation,

- Client-side or server-side form definition, and

- Client-side form building.

It uses a JSON form-definition protocol that allows for various client
side UI frameworks.

The framework can be used client-side only, or on both the client and
server.   The server famework is Python based.  It also provides
adapters for the Zope Toolkit, bobo, and for Webob.


.. [#whyframework] The jsonform framework has a number of different parts
  with different responsibilities:

  - The zc.jsonform Python package provides server-side support for
    server-side form definition and validation,

  - The jsonform json definition protocol provides client-side form
    definition, and

  - Client implementations written to the framework provide
    client-side form building and definition.  For example,
    zc.dojoform provides a client-side implementation for the dojo
    JavaScript framework.
