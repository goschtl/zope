Object Oriented Database (oodb)
*******************************

The oodb package is a namespace package to gather packages in support
of object-oriented databases based on the Z Object Database
Technology.  It's possible that packages currently in the ZODB
distribution will migrate here.

Don't bother installing this package. It doesn't provide any
code. It's just a place holder for the namespace package.
