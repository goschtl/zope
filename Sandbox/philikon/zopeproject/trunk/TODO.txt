* zc.buildout has a logging initialization bug (it doesn't tear down
  the logging handler, so subsequent logging calls are multiplied).
  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/zc.buildout/+bug/125729.

* Allow values to be provided thru command line arguments
  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/125817.

* README: explain what site.zcml, zope.conf are.

* README: explain how to add more dependencies to your new
  application.

* Maybe rename application.py to app_factory.py or something like
  that? (application.py sort of collides with grok's app.py)
