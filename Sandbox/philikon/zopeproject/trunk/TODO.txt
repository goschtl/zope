* zc.buildout has a logging initialization bug (it doesn't tear down
  the logging handler, so subsequent logging calls are multiplied).
  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/zc.buildout/+bug/125729.

* Allow values to be provided thru command line arguments
  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/125817.

* Maybe rename application.py to app_factory.py or something like
  that? (application.py sort of collides with grok's app.py)

* ftesting.zcml and testing.py

* Need tests!

* README: how to deploy?

* README: link to zc.buildout tutorial

* README: tell people about ~/.buildout/default.cfg

* Alter the way the eggs directory is added to buildout.cfg:

  - check if there's a default setting in ~/.buildout/default.cfg

  - if there's a default setting and the user simply takes that (by
    pressing return), buildout.cfg won't get a eggs-directory setting
    (but perhaps a comment instead mentioning that the default setting
    will be used).

  - if there's a default setting but the user chooses to enter a
    different directory, buildout.cfg will have the necessary
    eggs-directory setting.

  - if there's no default setting, zopeproject/grokproject will
    suggest a sensible eggs directory (e.g. ~/buildout-eggs) and
    buildout.cfg will have the necessary eggs-directory setting.

* Bring back bin/zopectl (fg, start/stop/status, debug)
