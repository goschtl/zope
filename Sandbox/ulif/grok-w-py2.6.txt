If you want to know what I did (all in a Python2.6 virtualenv):

1) Check out the grok trunk.

Then, alternatively:

2a) Download http://svn.zope.org/zopetoolkit/branches/jim-kgs/kgs/ztk.cfg
   and save it as versions.ztk.cfg.

3a) In versions.ztk.cfg remove all but the lower part starting with 
   [versions]. So you have a new versions.cfg.

4a) In buildout.cfg, after 'extends versions.cfg' add a new line::

   extends versions.ztk.cfg

or:

2b) In buildout.cfg refer to the above ztk.cfg using the buildout
    `extends` directive.

5) In buildout.cfg, in the [versions] section add an entry::

   martian = 0.11

   Grok still needs martian 0.11 (might be fixed on the sprint).

6) in src/grok/configure.zcml:

   comment out or remove the last adapter registration (which registers 
   for IReRaiseException). This means, that you have to go to 
   @@login.html if you want to login when the paster debugger was 
   started in background.

   The mentioned interface is registered with newer zope.publisher
   versions, but the current ZTK publisher still lacks this.
