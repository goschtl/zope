About these documents
=====================


These documents are generated from `reStructuredText
<http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html>`_ sources by *Sphinx*, an excellent
document processor specifically written for the Python documentation
by Georg Brandl and contributors.

In the online version of these documents, you can submit comments and suggest
changes directly on the documentation pages.

Development of this documentation and its toolchain takes place on the
grok-dev@zope.org mailing list.  We're always looking for volunteers
wanting to help with the docs, so feel free to send a mail there!

Many thanks go to:

* the `docutils <http://docutils.sf.net/>`_ project for creating
  reStructuredText and the docutils suite;
* Georg Brandl for his `sphinx` package.

See :ref:`reporting-bugs` for information how to report bugs in Python itself.

It is only with the input and contributions of the Grok community
that Grok has so much documentation -- Thank You!
