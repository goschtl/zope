   "Grok means to understand so thoroughly that the observer becomes a
   part of the observed --- merge, blend, intermarry, lose identity in
   group experience. It means almost everything that we mean by religion,
   philosophy, and science --- it means as little to us (because we are from
   Earth) as color means to a blind man." 

   -- `Robert A. Heinlein, Stranger in a Strange Land`

This is the grok reference documentation. It is organized by the Python
artefacts that implement the concepts.

Grok makes Zope 3 concepts more accessible for application
developers. This reference is not intended as introductory material
for those concepts. Please refer to the original Zope 3
documentation and the grok tutorial for introductory material.
