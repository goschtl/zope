Demo Applications for ``z3c.form`` and ``z3c.formui``
=====================================================

This package is a ``mars`` implementation which seeks to duplicate the original
z3c.formdemo demo applications.

The original README is README.z3c.txt.

`Grok`_ is a project which seeks to provide convention over configuration.

``Martian`` grew from `Grok`_:

The ``mars.*`` packages grew from answering the duties of the zcml directives
used to configure the original ``z3c.formdemo`` demos. These packages use both
`Grok`_ and ``Martian``.  ``Martian`` to register the ``Grokkers`` and `Grok`_
does the grokking.

``message``, ``spreadsheet``, ``questionnaire``, ``widgets``, ``addressbook``,
``sqlmessage`` and ``wizard`` have all been included.
