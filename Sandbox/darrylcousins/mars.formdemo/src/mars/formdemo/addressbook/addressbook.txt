Addressbook Demo
================

The purpose of the addressbook demo is to demonstrate a complex, form-driven
UI with several sub-forms and table-integration.

To start, we need to open a browser and go to the demo applications overview
screen:

  >>> from z3c.formdemo import testing
  >>> from z3c.etestbrowser.testing import ExtendedTestBrowser
  >>> user = ExtendedTestBrowser()
  >>> user.handleErrors = False
  >>> user.addHeader('Accept-Language', 'en')
  >>> skinURL = 'http://localhost:8080/++skin++marsformdemo'

  >>> user.open('http://localhost:8080')

Since all demos are purely public, there is no need to log in. Let's now click
on the "Address Book" link:

  >>> user.open(skinURL + '/addressbook')
  >>> print user.contents
