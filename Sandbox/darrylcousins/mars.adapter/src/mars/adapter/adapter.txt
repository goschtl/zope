Mars Adapter
============

This package offers a simple factory grokker to register adapters. More complex
adapters can be built using the grok.Adapter class but often we want to register
an existing adapter factory in a simple way. Example of the use of this adapter
factory can be found in `mars.formdemo` where it used to register button and
labels for `z3c.form`.

Set up
------

First we make a few imports and then define two interfaces. The first, `IValue`
is the interface to which our `field` object will be adapted to and the second,
`IField` defines the interface that the `field` object will directly implement.

  >>> import zope.interface
  >>> import zope.component
  >>> import grok
  >>> import mars.adapter
  >>> class IValue(zope.interface.Interface):
  ...     pass
  >>> class IField(zope.interface.Interface):
  ...     pass

Now we define the `Field` object.

  >>> class Field(object):
  ...     """A field"""
  ...     zope.interface.implements(IField)

And create the object to be used later.

  >>> field = Field()

The Adapter
-----------

Here we define an adapter that we wish to look up for the `field` object. It is
a simple adapter that will take only the adapted object in its __init__ method.

  >>> class ValueAdapter(object):
  ...     """Static value adapter."""
  ...     zope.component.adapts(IField)
  ...     zope.interface.implements(IValue)
  ...
  ...     def __init__(self, context):
  ...         self.context = context
  ...
  ...     def __repr__(self):
  ...         return self.__class__.__name__

Un-named Adapter
----------------

Then we can define the adapter factory that subclasses AdapterFactory and
contains a single directive (which is required) that defines the factory to be
used.

  >>> class UnNamedValueAdapter(mars.adapter.AdapterFactory):
  ...     mars.adapter.factory(ValueAdapter)

In the test we manually ``grok`` the factory, normally this happens when a
module is ``grokked`` on start up.

  >>> from mars.adapter.meta import AdapterFactoryGrokker
  >>> AdapterFactoryGrokker().grok('unnamed', UnNamedValueAdapter, Field, None, None)
  True

It should now be possible to retrieve the adapter from the component
architecture.

  >>> print zope.component.queryAdapter(field, IValue)
  ValueAdapter

Named Adapter
------------

This example differs from the first only that we wish now to be able to look up
the adapter using a name. To do this it is only required that we add the
``grok.name`` directive.

  >>> class NamedValueAdapter(mars.adapter.AdapterFactory):
  ...     grok.name('named')
  ...     mars.adapter.factory(ValueAdapter)

Again we manually ``grok`` the factory.

  >>> AdapterFactoryGrokker().grok('named', NamedValueAdapter, Field, None, None)
  True

It should now be possible to retrieve the adapter from the component
architecture using the name defined.

  >>> print zope.component.queryAdapter(field, IValue, 'named')
  ValueAdapter
