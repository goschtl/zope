============
tfws.website
============

tfws.website is installed via buildout <http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout>.

You may have setuptools already installed for your system Python. In
that case, you may need to upgrade it first because buildout requires
a very recent version::

    $ sudo easy_install -U setuptools

If this command fails because easy_install is not available, there is
a good chance you do not have setuptools available for your system
Python. If so, there is no problem because setuptools will be
installed locally by buildout.

Bootstrapping
-------------

Bootstrap the buildout environment::

    $ python bootstrap/bootstrap.py

If you do not have a ~/.buildout/default.cfg I suggest creating it and adding
the following::

    [buildout]
    eggs-directory=/path/to/buildout/eggs
    develop-eggs-directory=/path/to/buildout/develop-eggs

This file is read when buildout is run and will re-use the eggs already
installed.

and run the buildout command::

    $ bin/buildout [-N]
    [lots of stuff will be downloaded and installed locally here]

Testing
-------

Test the installation::

   $ bin/test [website]

Because we have additional packages installed as develop eggs
(z3c.authentication and z3c.resource) the option ``website`` causes only tests
in the tfws.website package to be run.

Running the selenium tests
--------------------------

Start the selenium application::

    $ bin/paster serve selenium.ini

If you now connect to port 8034 and run the suite of selenium tests. Note that
the test suite creates and installs a test site to run the tests on (as do the
functional tests).

Running the website
-------------------

Start the application::

    $ bin/paster serve deploy.ini

If you now connect to port 8080 and log in with username 'tfws',
password 'tfws'. From there you can add a website.
