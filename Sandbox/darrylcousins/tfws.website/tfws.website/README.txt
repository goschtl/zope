tfws.website

This website application borrows heavily from z3c.website and other z3c
packages. It is however in essence a `Grok`_ application and uses most or all
of the `Mars`_ packages for component definitions and registration.

Although the intention is to use it also in production the focus of development
is to produce a demo application for the `Mars`_ packages. It is the second demo
application, the first being `mars.formdemo`_.
