Buildout needs Python 2.4.4 and Zope needs a C-compiler

On Debian/Ubuntu, install: python2.4 python2.4-dev build-essential

Locate the system python and run "easy_install virtualenv"

Run "virtualenv python" in your buildout directory. You can change the name python to anything suitable. This will create a python executable + all libs.

Run bootstrap and buildout with the new python:
./python/bin/python2.4 bootstrap.py (Python might be called something else)
./bin/buildout (Fetches all the packages)
./bin/instance fg (Starts the server in debug-mode/foreground)

Play ball!
