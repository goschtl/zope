This directory is a sandbox for Zope Corporation projects.  We make projects
available here for the community that we plan to move to the open source 
repository but that we are still working with.  As such, the releases are 
snapshots from ongoing work in the zope.com repositories.

We invite comments on these projects.

Projects in the Sandbox typically require Python >= 2.4.1.

  This package currently expects to live in zc.page.  When it is moved to the
  Zope 3 tree it will probably live as zope.page.  It is a replacement, largely
  by Jim Fulton, of the functionality provided by the forms (not the widgets)
  in zope.app.form.
