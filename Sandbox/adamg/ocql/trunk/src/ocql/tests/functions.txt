Simple in expression (eg select):
    >>> sorted(engine.compile("set [ i in ICourse| i ]").execute())

Simple condition (eg where):
    >>> engine.compile("list [ d in IDepartment; d.name == \"Computing Science\" | d  ]").execute()
    [Department <Computing Science>]

Join using existentially quantified expressions:

Size expression in the result:

    [Course <C3>]

Size operator in the result:
