========

This package contains classes related to database specific functions.

index.py:
---------
There is a special index which holds all instances of objects with a specified
interface. This is needed to be able to simply retrieve all instances of a kind.

metadata.py:
------------
Classes here provide information about the data in the database and object
instances as well.
This is the gateway between the engine and the database.
