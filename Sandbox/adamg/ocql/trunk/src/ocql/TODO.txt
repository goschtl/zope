Problem: we want to test object equality by intid, what if the object defines
         it's own __cmp__? Object needs to be loaded and __cmp__ called.

Problem: we seem to add classes related to optimization to the general
         algebra classes. zope index related optimizations might not be mixed
         with the general algebra classes.
         Even the optimization depends more and more on the database.
         Think about how to make this more general, or how to put database
         dependent classes separated.
         More general question: how to do the optimization that it knows about
         the database properties but ....
         Seems that the optimization will be either split into two parts: one
         database independent-generic, one database dependent -- or -- it will
         be one part and that part depends always on the database.
