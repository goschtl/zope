CMF Collector Update Notes

  This file is for notes about crucial considerations for updating
  preexisting collectors to the current release.  You should always
  check here when doing updates for instructions about accommodating
  changes, when necessary.

  The file is ordered most recent items first, and the items refer to
  the collector version as indicated by the VERSION.text file in the
  same directory.

  Version 0.9, Oct 25, 2001

    - With this version owners of previously existing collectors will
      have to sneak a visit to the configure page for previously
      existing collectors before anyone can browse and search them.

      To do so, after putting the new Product code in place (and
      restarting your site, if you don't have auto-refresh going)
      collector owners should go to the URL produced by appending
      "/collector_edit_form" to the URL of the collectors - eg::

        http://new.zope.org/Members/klm/ColDev/collector_edit_form

      for the example collector at http://new.zope.org/Members/klm/ColDev.

      Check the box by "Reinstate internal catalog?", to the right of
      the submit and reset buttons at the bottom of the form, and then
      submit them.  This will establish a new, internal catalog as
      well as indexing all the items against it and the site catalog
      (using changed schemas).

      These changes solve the issue discussed at
      http://new.zope.org/Members/klm/ColDev/25 - see there for details.
