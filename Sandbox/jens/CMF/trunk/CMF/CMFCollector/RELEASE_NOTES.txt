CMF Collector Update Notes

  This file is for notes about crucial considerations for updating
  preexisting collectors to the current release.  You should always
  check here when doing updates for instructions about accommodating
  changes, when necessary.

  The file is ordered most recent items first, and the items refer to

  Version 0.9a, Oct 25, 2001

    - This version requires two installation changes.

      - The first is simple - replace (or adjust) the workflow.  You can
        either:

        - install the new collector issue workflow, by first
          deleting the existing one (in the portal_workflow tool
          'contents' tab) and installing the new one, according to the
          instructions in INSTALL.txt, or

        - adjust the existing one, by adding the 'request' transition to
          the 'Pending' and 'Pending_confidential' states.  (Visit the
          collector_issue_workflow within the portal_workflow tool, go
          to states, enabling the 'request' transition in each.)

      - Until the collector owner does the second, noone will be able to
        browse your collector.  The owners have to go directly to the
        configure form for their collectors and pick an option that
        instates the new, collector-internal catalog and recatalogs all
        the issues.

        To do so, after putting the new Product code in place (and
        restarting your site, if you don't have auto-refresh going)
        collector owners should go to the URL produced by appending
        "/collector_edit_form" to the URL of the collectors - eg::

          http://new.zope.org/Members/klm/ColDev/collector_edit_form

        for the example collector at http://new.zope.org/Members/klm/ColDev.

        Check the box by "Reinstate internal catalog?", to the right of
        the submit and reset buttons at the bottom of the form, and then
        submit them.  This will establish a new, internal catalog as
        well as indexing all the items against it and the site catalog
        (using changed schemas).

        These changes solve the issue discussed at
        http://new.zope.org/Members/klm/ColDev/25 - see there for details.

        This version also entails a change to the collector issue
        workflow.  You can either delete the old workflow and import the
        new one (see the INSTALL.txt file for instructions), or just go
        to the portal workflow tool and enable the 'request' transition
        on the
