"""This file is an installation script (External method) for the CMF Collector.

To use, add an external method to the root of the CMF Site that you want CMF
Event registered in with the configuration:

 id: install_collector
 title (optional): Install Collector 
 module name: CMFCollector.Install
 function name: install

Then go to the management screen for the newly added external method
and click the 'Try it' tab.  The install function will execute and give
information about the steps it took to register and install the
CMF Events into the CMF Site instance.
