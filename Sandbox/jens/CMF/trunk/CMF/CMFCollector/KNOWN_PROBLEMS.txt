CMFCollector Known Problems

  Nov 7, 2001 - Special actions when importing a collector --
    You can move a collector across sites, and within a site, using
    export/import - but you have to take a couple of special actions
    to make this work.

    1. You must _disable_ the issue workflow connection during import of
       a collector, in order to avoid spurious workflow transitions.

       Probably the simplest way to disable the workflow connection is
       to go to the portal_workflow tool's "Workflows" tab in the Zope
       Management Interface and change the setting for "Collector
       Issue" to be empty.  Then do the import, and make sure to
       reestablish the Collector Issue Workflows setting to
       "collector_issue_workflow".

    2. Now you have to reinstate the catalog settings for the imported
       collector.

       You do this in the collector's "configure" page, which is
       available in the collector's "browse" view actions box (if you
       own the collector or otherwise have manage privilege).  At the
       "Reinstate catalog" activity at the bottom of the page, check
       "Internal and Site-wide" and submit.

    The state of all the imported collector issues should now be
    properly resurrected and indexed in the site and the collector's
    internal catalog.

  Oct 27, 2001 - Catalog search "active" content culling disabled --
    The CMF catalog search is supposed to automatically cull out items
    with expired expiration_date and/or unreached effective_date,
    unless the visitor has AccessFuturePortalContent and/or
    AccessInactivePortalContent permissions.  This culling is not
    working correctly for the collector's internal catalog, at least
    in some versions, culling out *all* results.

    This looks like a CMF and/or ZCatalog bug, and i haven't been able
    to track where the proper behavior is supposed to be implemented.
    Hence, i've punted on this, and am setting collectors to grant
    Anonymous AccessInactivePortalContent and
    AccessFuturePortalContent (in Collector.py addCollectorIssue()),
    meaning that the active-status culling will not happen - even when
    you want it to - within the collector.  I'll be revisiting this
    workaround when i know more about how to solve the actual problem.
    
  Oct, 2001 - Must add collectors via the CMF (folder-view "New") interface --
    You cannot add collector instances via the Zope management
    interface.  This may or may not be a difficult thing to solve.
