CMFCollector Known Problems

  Oct 27, 2001 Catalog search "active" content culling disabled --
    The CMF catalog search is supposed to automatically cull out items
    with expired expiration_date and/or unreached effective_date,
    unless the visitor has AccessFuturePortalContent and/or
    AccessInactivePortalContent permissions.  This culling is not
    working correctly for the collector's internal catalog, at least
    in some versions, culling out *all* results.

    This looks like a CMF and/or ZCatalog bug, and i haven't been able
    to track where the proper behavior is supposed to be implemented.
    Hence, i've punted on this, and am setting collectors to grant
    Anonymous AccessInactivePortalContent and
    AccessFuturePortalContent (in Collector.py addCollectorIssue()),
    meaning that the active-status culling will not happen - even when
    you want it to - within the collector.  I'll be revisiting this
    workaround when i know more about how to solve the actual problem.
