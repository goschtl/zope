Future

  New Features

    - (__future__) Exposed role management for manager users on the
      default roster:  managers can now "promote" members without going
      to the ZMI.

    - (__future__) Added "custom schema" mechanism for content objects:
      site managers can now define additional propertysheets for a
      content type, which will then be reflected in instances created
      from the type.

    - (__future__) Added simple link extraction / checking for textual
      content.  Link checking also works for Link objects.

    - (__future__) Added "composite content" types (see the "dogbowl
      proposal",
      (http://cmf.zope.org/rqmts/proposals/compounds/compoundproposal.txt).

    - (__future__) Added DCWorkflow (through-the-web configurable
      workflows) to the core set of CMF products.
