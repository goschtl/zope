New Features

  - Added functionality such that only users who have the
    view permission on the relevent Type object can create
    content of that type.

  - Added the ability to limit what types of object an
    object of a given Portal Type can be created in. 

    If 'Implicity Addable' is set (the default), then 
    objects of that Type can be added anywhere.

    If it is not set, then objects of that Type can only be 
    added to objects whose Type's allowed_content_types
    contains the Type.

  - (__future__) Exposed role management for manager users on
      the default roster:  managers can now "promote" members
      without going to the ZMI.

  - (__future__) Added "custom schema" mechanism for content
    objects:  site managers can now define additional
    propertysheets for a content type, which will then be
    reflected in instances created from the type.

   - (__future__) Added simple link extraction / checking for
     textual content.  Link checking also works for Link objects.

  - (__future__) Added "composite content" types (see the
    "dogbowl proposal",
    (http://cmf.zope.org/rqmts/proposals/compounds/compoundproposal.txt).

  - Enabled querying actions from workflow tool in absence
    of actions tool (Tracker #401).

  - Added 'operator' attribute to CMFTopic.ListCriterion, to permit
    specifying an operator ('and', for the most part) for indexes which
    support it, e.g., KeywordIndex (Tracker #442).

  - Added ZMI interface for editing Link URL (Tracker #364).

  - (__future__) Added DCWorkflow (through-the-web configurable
      workflows) to the core set of CMF products.

Bugs Fixed

  - Gave URL tool explicit __roles__, to enable use in 'nocall:'
    expressions.

  - Turned off auto-expansion of customized FSPageTemplates
    (Tracker #477).
    
  - Fixed ActionProvidorBase for the case when no permission 
    is specified for an action that is added TTW.

  - Fixed ActionsTool so that duplicate actions are stripped.

  - Caused CMFDefault Portal constructor to strip passed-in id
    before creating a portal object with that id.

  - Allowed the ActionsTool to gracefully handle objects
    which return ActionInformation objects. Thanks to 
    Andy Dawkins for the analysis. (Tracker #457)

  - Made workflow Expressions use the correct ModuleImporter
    so that they operate correctly in their restricted 
    environment. Thanks to Dieter Maurer for the patch.
    (Tracker 463)

  - Fixed incorrent permissions in "pending" state of default 
    DCWorkflows. Thanks for Lynn Walton for the report and 
    Florent Guillaume for the patch. (Tracker #464)

  - Fixed missing comma that affected manager permission to modify
    in the published state. Thanks to Florent Guillaume for the 
    patch (Tracker #459)

  - html_quote'd errors raised by FSPageTemplates. Thanks to 
    Dieter Maurer for the patch. (Tracker #462)

  - Fixed typo in zpt_stylesheet.css. Thanks to Florent Guillaume
    for the patch. (Tracker #461)

  - Fixed long standing bug in FSPythonScript where get_size returned
    the incorrect length. This broke editing using EMACS via FTP or
    WebDAV. Thanks to John Glavin at South River Technologies for
    help finding the bug.

  - Reworked functionality added in Tracker #409 which broke the 
    Types Tool. (Tracker #458)

  - Fixed bug whereby DirectoryView instances were not noticing
    some of the changes they should when Zope was running in debug mode
    on Windows (Tracker #305)

  - Fixed a bug where the workflow notifyCreated method was called during
    manage_afterAdd in PortalContent, making it possible for the
    notification to occur on the wrong workflow.  The notification has 
    moved to the contstructInstance method on the TypesTool after
    the _setPortalTypeName method has been called on the object.

  - Extended TypesTool to permit registration of new TypeInformation
    implementations (Tracker #409, thanks to Jeffrey Shell for the
    work!)

  - Fixed a bug in Favorites.getObject to use restrictedTraverse on the portal
    object.

  - Made all tool-generated actions configurable through-the-web,
    via an "Actions" tab on each tool;  made the list of ActionProviders
    configurable TTW as well.

  - Fixed setting the Link.format to URL_FORMAT so the initially returned
    metadata headers would return 'text/url' properly.  Added unittests.

  - Enabled querying actions from workflow tool in absence
    of actions tool (Tracker #401).

  - Fixed CMFDefault.utils.parseHeadersBody to properly handle the headers
    generated on a windows app (i.e. Dreamweaver) with /r/n; added the
    compiled regular expression object to the method signature.

  - Added full webdav sipport code to Link.py.  Changed _writeFromPUT to call
    _editMetadata instead of editMetadata.

  - Made links emitted by 'topic_view' play nice with virtual hosting
    (Tracker #433).

  - Cleaned up emission of RFC822-style headers (Tracker #407),
    terminating headers must be terminated with CRLF, and padding
    continuation lines (for values with embedded newlines) with
    leading whitespace).

  - Ensure that package initialization files are non-empty, to prevent
      suspicion that they were corrupted in download (Tracker #426).

  - Added external method update_catalogIndexes.py to run as part of a
    upgrade to CMFs migrating to Zope2.4+ from from CMF sites which were built
    using Zope2.3 catalog

  - Use ID to label Favorite when target has an empty Title (Tracker #440).

  - Allowed sub-folders to have different syndication properties 
    than parents (Tracker #421).

  - Added 'CMFDefault.Upgrade.upgrade_decor_skins' external method to
    convert existing sites which had installed skin directories from the
    now-deprecated 'CMFDecor' product (Tracker #434).  Added note
    explaining the issue, and the workaround, to 'ISSUES.txt'.

  - Ensure that Favorites display the correct, absolute URL to their
    target, without needing to have <base> tag set (Tracker #419).

  - Worked around Opera's strange insistence on selecting an option,
    even for multi-select lists (Tracker #332).

  - Hardened CMFCore to initialize correctly in the absence of
    the PageTemplates product (Tracker #430).

  - Restored slot in <head> of ZPT main template into which content
    can insert the <base> tag (Tracker #418).

  - Fixed 'CMFTopic.SimpleIntegerCriterion.edit' to require a pair
    of values when 'direction' is 'min:max';  updated skins to use
    new 'getValueString', which renders such values properly
    (Tracker #439).

  - Ensured that Documents created with initial STX get cooked
    (Tracker #435).

  - Made links emitted by 'topic_view' play nice with virtual hosting
    (Tracker #433).

  - Made 'CMFCore/interfaces/__init__.py' non-empty, to remove suspicion
    that the file was corrupted in the download (Tracker #426).
