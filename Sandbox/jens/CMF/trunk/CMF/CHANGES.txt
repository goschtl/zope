CMF 1.5alpha (unreleased)

  New Features

    - MembershipTool (CMFCore and CMFDefault): Changed member area creation.
      'wrapUser()' does no longer call 'createMemberarea()'.
      'createMemberarea()' should now be called from the 'logged_in' page.

    - MembershipTool (CMFDefault): Added a customization hook to
      'createMemberarea()'. A 'createMemberContent' script placed inside the
      tool overrides default member content creation.
