 New Features

   - (__future__) Exposed role management for manager users on
       the default roster:  managers can now "promote" members
       without going to the ZMI.

   - (__future__) Added "custom schema" mechanism for content
     objects:  site managers can now define additional
     propertysheets for a content type, which will then be
     reflected in instances created from the type.

    - (__future__) Added simple link extraction / checking for
      textual content.  Link checking also works for Link objects.

   - (__future__) Added "composite content" types (see the
     "dogbowl proposal",
     (http://cmf.zope.org/rqmts/proposals/compounds/compoundproposal.txt).

   - (__future__) Added DCWorkflow (through-the-web configurable
       workflows) to the core set of CMF products.

   - Extended the metadata tool to permit passing the type name
     directly (e.g., when building a new object, one might need to
     know the allowed subjects before construction).

   - Added a working implementation behind the CMFCalendar product.
     Thanks to Andy Dawkins for the work.

   - You can now add .security files to control the role to permissions
     mappings on skin methods.
     See CMFCore/tests/fake_skins/fake_skin/test4.py.security for an
     example.
