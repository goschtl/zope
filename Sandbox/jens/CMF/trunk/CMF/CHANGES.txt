CMF 1.5alpha (unreleased)

  New Features

    - zpt skin: Added batch_widgets.pt and getBatchNavigation.py.
      roster and search use now the new navigation macro. Looks like before,
      but i18n works better and it's easier to reuse or replace the code.

    - zpt skin: Added zpt version of registered_notify_template.

    - CMFCorePermissions: Made them available for import by Scripts.

    - CMFCore MembershipTool and MemberDataTool: Added 'delete' methods.

      o deleteMemberData() deletes the member data of a member.

      o deleteMemberArea() deletes the member area of a member.

      o deleteLocalRoles() now has a 'recursive' argument.

      o deleteMembers() deletes members including member data, member area and
        Local Roles.

    - CMFCore MembershipTool: Changed interface.

      o createMemberarea() is now called createMemberArea(). For backwards
        compatibility createMemberarea is a deprecated alias.

      o getMembersFolder() is now also part of the CMFCore interface.

    - CMFCorePermissions: Added 'Change local roles' Permission.
      PortalFolder's 'Local Roles' Action and MembershipTool's Local Roles
      methods are now guarded by 'Change local roles' of the object.

    - Added CMFCoreExceptions: Errors defined in this module are available for
      import by Scripts. In the long run, all Errors defined in CMF should be
      moved to this module and subclassed from CMFError. Subclassed standard
      errors should only be used for end user focused raise statements.

    - CMFCore and CMFDefault MembershipTool: Changed permissions.
      'createMemberarea()' for someone else and 'getRoster()' including hidden
      members are now protected by 'Manage users'. 'getMemberById()',
      listMemberIds() and listMembers() as well.

    - Document and NewsItem: Un-hardwired 'manage_FTPget()' for 'text/html'.
      Added 'source_html.dtml' and 'source_html.pt'. 'manage_FTPget()' now has
      a 'gethtml' hook and uses 'source_html' by default. (Collector #168)

    - TypeInformation: Added Method Aliases.

      o TypesTool and TypeInformation now have an 'Aliases' tab to configure
        Method Aliases TTW.

      o factory_type_information now has a key 'aliases' to configure Method
        Aliases in a product. This key is required, but may be empty: If it
        doesn't exist, TypeInformation will try to update by guessing aliases.

      o DynamicType manipulates 'TraversalRequestNameStack' depending on
        Method Aliases. '(Default)' and 'view' aliases bypass __call__() and
        view() methods on traversal.

      o PortalFolder's 'mkdir' hook now makes use of Method Aliases.

    - CMFCore and CMFDefault MembershipTool: Changed member area creation.
      'wrapUser()' does no longer call 'createMemberarea()'.
      'createMemberarea()' should now be called from the 'logged_in' page.

    - CMFDefault MembershipTool: Added a customization hook to
      'createMemberarea()'. A 'createMemberContent' script placed inside the
      tool overrides default member content creation.

  Bug Fixes

    - Skin scripts: Made except statements safer by being more specific. Hope
      this still catches all relevant errors.

    - Removed some pre 'Zope 2.4.3 with PageTemplates' backwards compatibility
      cruft. A later platform is required since CMF 1.3.

    - Collector #153: CookieCrumbler didn't preserve query strings.
