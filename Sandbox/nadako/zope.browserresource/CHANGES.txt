3.9.0 (unreleased)
==================

Initial release. This package was splitted off zope.app.publisher as a part
of refactoring process.

Additional changes that are made during refactoring:

 * Fix stripping the "I" from an interface name for icon title, if no
   title is specified.

 * When publishing a resource via Resources view, set resource parent
   to an ISite object, not to current site manager.

 * Clean up code and improve test coverage a little.
