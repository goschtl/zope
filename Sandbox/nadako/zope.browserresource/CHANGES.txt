3.9.0 (unreleased)
==================

Initial release. This package was splitted off zope.app.publisher as a part
of refactoring process.

Additional changes that are made during refactoring:

 * Resource class for file resources are now selected the pluggable way.
   The resource directory publisher and browser:resource ZCML directive
   now creating file resources using factory utility lookup based on the
   file extension, so it's now possible to add new resource types without
   introducing new ZCML directives and they will work inside resource
   directories as well.
   
   NOTE: the "resource_factories" attribute from the DirectoryResource
   was removed, so if you were using this attribute for changing resource
   classes for some file extensions, you need to migrate your code to new
   utility-based mechanism.

   See zope.browserresource.interfaces.IResourceFactoryFactory interface.

 * Fix stripping the "I" from an interface name for icon title, if no
   title is specified.

 * When publishing a resource via Resources view, set resource parent
   to an ISite object, not to current site manager.

 * Clean up code and improve test coverage a little.
