3.9.0 (unreleased)
==================

Initial release. This package was splitted off zope.app.publisher as a part
of refactoring process.

Additional changes that are made during refactoring:

 * Fix a regular expression that were used for icon titles when titles
   are not specified in the icon directive. It does strip the "I" from
   the interface name as intended.

 * When publishing a resource via Resources view, set resource parent
   to an ISite object, not to current site manager.

 * Clean up code and improve test coverage a little.
