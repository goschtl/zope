Framework
---------

 1. Create custom Buttons with javascript callbacks (versus submit
    buttons).

 2. Create AJAXForm object where submit buttons use jquery form
    submitters with js success/error callbacks.

 3. create input widgets that behave like display widgets until you
    click on them.

 4. create jquery listener for server-side events.  for example, an
    item is added to a container, and someones page in their browser
    gets reloaded to show the new data.

 5. pre-submission javascript field validation.


Examples
--------

 1. Write examples for custom buttons

 2. Write examples for AJAXForm objects.

 3. write examples for framework 3.

 4. Write examples for Framework 4.
