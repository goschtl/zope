Given a method of a newstyle class, normally trying to pickle a method results
in an exception.

    >>> import cPickle
    >>> class Foo(object):
    ...     def __init__(self, name):
    ...         self.name = name
    ...     def bar(self):
    ...         print "hi", self.name
    ...
    >>> foo = Foo('gary')
    >>> cPickle.dumps(foo.bar)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: can't pickle instancemethod objects

If you register methodpickle's pickler, it works like a charm.

    >>> from zope.zasync import methodpickle
    >>> methodpickle.register()
    >>> cPickle.loads(cPickle.dumps(foo.bar))()
    hi gary

The approach is simpleminded, and produces bigger pickles than it could, but
it works.
