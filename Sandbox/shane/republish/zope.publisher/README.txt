The zope.publisher package provides interfaces and base classes for
publishing Python objects on the web.  The interfaces support plain
HTTP/WebDAV clients, web browsers, XML-RPC, and FTP clients.
The interfaces are geared towards WSGI compatibility.

The implementation portion of this package has moved to the
``zope.pipeline`` package.
