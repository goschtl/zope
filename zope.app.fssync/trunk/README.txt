FSSync

.. contents::

The FSSync project (zope.app.fssync) provides support for filesystem 
synchronization of Zope3 content that resides in a ZODB. This package defines
a Web-based API with basic support for some standard zope.app content 
types and the standard security policy.

This project is build on top of the more general zope.fssync package which 
provides object serialization and deserialization tools. If you need a pure 
Python API which is independent of the ZODB and the Zope3 security machinery you 
should look at zope.fssync. 

FSSync includes a command line client that resembles svn or cvs. Type 

    bin/zsync help
    
for available commands and further information. If you want to see the zsync 
client in action you can run the demo application

    bin/demo -fg
    
Add a 'demo' folder and some files within this folder via the ZMI. After that
run

    bin/zsync checkout http://zsync:zsync@localhost:8080/demo ./parts/checkout

Edit a file in the checkout directory and run

    bin/zsync commit ./parts/checkout
    
The modified file should now be available on the server.


Extending zsync
---------------

The zsync script is generated by the following part of the buildout.cfg::

    [zsync]
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    eggs = zope.app.fssync
    entry-points = zsync=zope.app.fssync.main:main

If you want to use zope.app.fssync in your own application you propably have
to define application specific serializers and deserializers. See 

    zope/app/fssync/fssync.txt
    
for further documentation. You probably also need your own zsync script with
additional dependencies. Simply add the necessary eggs to the corresponding
buildout snippet of your project.
