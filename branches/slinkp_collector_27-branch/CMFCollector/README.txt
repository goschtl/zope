CMFCollector README

  The CMFCollector is starting out as a rudimentary issue tracker, to
  replace the equally rudimentary, ancient collector we've been using
  on zope.org for a long time.  It is being implemented as CMF content
  to enable evolution to a more comprehensive solution with time.

  See INSTALL.txt for instructions about installing in your CMF site.
