PluggableAuthService changelog

  PluggableAuthService 1.0.3 (2004/10/16)

    Bugs Fixed

      - Implemented support for issuing challenges via IChallengePlugins.

        - three challenge styles in particular:

          - HTTP Basic Auth

          - CookieCrumbler-like redirection

          - Inline authentication form

      - Made unit tests pass when run with cAccessControl.

      - plugins/ZODBRoleManager.py: don't claim authority for 'Authenticated'
        or 'Anonymous' roles, which are managed by PAS.

      - plugins/ZODBRoleManager.py: don't freak out if a previously assigned
        principal goes away.

      - plugins/ZODBGroupManager.py: don't freek out if a previously assigned
        principal goes away.

      - plugins/ZODBUserManager.py: plugin now uses AuthEncoding for its
        password encryption so that we can more easily support migrating
        existing UserFolders. Since PAS has been out for a while,
        though, we still will authenticate against old credentials

      - Repaired arrow images in two-list ZMI views.

      - searchPrincipals will work for exact matches when a plugin supports
        both 'enumerateUsers' and 'enumerateGroups'.

      - 'Authenticated' Role is now added dynamically by the
        PluggableAuthService, not by any role manager

      - Added WARNING-level logs with tracebacks for all swallowed
        plugin exceptions, so that you notice that there is something
        wrong with the plugins.

      - All authenticateCredentials() returned a single None when they
        could not authenticate, although all calls expected a tuple.

      - The user id in extract user now calls _verifyUser to get the ID
        mangled by the enumeration plugin, instead of mangling it with the
        authentication ID, thereby allowing the authentication and
        enumeration plugins to be different plugins.


  PluggableAuthService 1.0.2 (2004/07/15)

    Bugs Fixed

      - ZODBRoleManager and ZODBGroupManager needed the "two_lists" view,
        and associated images, which migrated to the PluginRegsitry product
        when they split;  restored them.

  PluggableAuthService 1.0.1 (2004/05/18)

    Bugs Fixed

      - CookieAuth plugin didn't successfully set cookies (first, because
        of a NameError, then, due to a glitch with long lines).

      - Missing ZPL in most modules.

  PluggableAuthService 1.0 (2004/04/29)

    - Initial release
