\chapter{Decorators}

grok uses a few decorators to register functions or methods for specific
functionality.

    \section{\function{grok.subscribe} -- Register a function as a subscriber
    for an event}

    Similar to Zope 3's \function{zope.component.subscriber} decorator, the
    function where it is applied to is registered as a subscriber for an event. 




    \section{grok.action}
