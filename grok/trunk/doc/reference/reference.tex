\date{\today}   % update before release!

                % doesn't cause a new date to be used.  Setting
                % the date to \today can be used during draft
                % stages to make it easier to handle versions.

\release{unreleased}      % release version; this is used to define the
                          % \version macro

\makeindex          % tell \index to actually write the .idx file

Grok: now even cavemen can use Zope 3!

\begin{notice}
``Grok means to understand so thoroughly that the observer becomes a part of the
observed --- merge, blend, intermarry, lose identity in group experience.
It means almost everything that we mean by religion, philosophy, and
science --- it means as little to us (because we are from Earth) as color
means to a blind man.'' -- Robert A. Heinlein, Stranger in a Strange Land
