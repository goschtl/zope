What is grok?
=============

Grok makes it easier to get started with a Zope 3 web application.

Grok uses the Component Architecture and builds on Zope 3 concepts
like content objects (models), views, and adapters.  Its simplicity
lies in using **convention over configuration** and **sensible
defaults** when wiring components together.  That means neither a
configuration language like ZCML nor a lot of repitition are needed to
create a web application with grok.
