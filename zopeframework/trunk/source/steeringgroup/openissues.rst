Open Issues
===========

These are issues that are currently under discussion and on which the
steering group will want to make a decision soon.

* Do we want to deprecate the deprecation system?

* Do we want to remove ZCML slugs from the individual projects?

.. note:: 
   We may want to move over the management of such issues to
   launchpad? Not?
