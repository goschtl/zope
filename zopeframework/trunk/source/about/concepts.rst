Summary of concepts
-------------------

We summarize some terms and concepts so we can all agree on how we
refer to things in discussions.

* Zope 2: the Zope 2 application server.

* Zope 3 (preferred: Zope 3 application server): Zope 3 as an
  application server, includes a way to create projects. Currently
  also contains the ZMI.

* Grok web framework: Grok, very similar to the Zope 3 application
  server, but with extra Grok libraries and policy, and Grok
  community.

* Repoze: a set of libraries that builds on Zope technology, reuse
  Zope concepts and expand on Zope technology.

* Plone: a CMS based on Zope 2 and the CMF that is a major consumer of
  Zope Toolkit technology.

* Zope Toolkit: the collection of Zope Toolkit core
  libraries. Shouldn't include the ZMI and doesn't include a
  particular way to create a project.

* Zope Toolkit release: a set of Zope Toolkit library versions
  that have been tested to work together. This set receives a
  collective version number ("Zope Toolkit 3.5"). A release could
  simply consist of a list of version numbers.

* Zope Toolkit Steering Group: the group responsible for the leading
  Zope Toolkit development, ensuring its continued evolution driven
  by the concerns of the various consumers of the toolkit (or
  particular libraries in the toolkit).

* Zope core library: a library within the Zope Toolkit.

* Zope extra library: a library not within the Zope Toolkit. Could
  be "just not" within the Zope Toolkit, or "not yet", or "not
  anymore". These libraries are intended to work with the Zope
  Toolkit and are maintained by the wider Zope community.
