Development process
===================

This area covers the procedures and guidelines we adhere to when
developing Zope Framework components.

.. note::
    This area currently is heavy work-in-progress. We are pulling in
    existing documents from various places that might not be up-to-date
    yet or not 100% accepted. We provide them both for historical
    reference and to allow us build up new documents on their basis.
