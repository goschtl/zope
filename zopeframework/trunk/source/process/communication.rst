Communication
=============

Communication for the Zope Framework development itself happens both
on IRC and in a mailinglist.

IRC
---

We use #zope3-dev on the IRC network provided by `freenode.net
<http://www.freenode.net>`_.


Mailing list
------------

The official Zope Framework development mailing list is
zope-dev@zope.org. You can subscribe to it by visiting
http://mail.zope.org/mailman/listinfo/zope-dev.

.. note::
    In the earlier days of Zope 3 development we used to have a
    separate mailing list for development on Zope 3
    (zope3-dev@zope.org). This list was merged into the general
    zope-dev@zope.org list a while ago.
