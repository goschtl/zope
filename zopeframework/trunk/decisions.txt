Decisions of the Zope Framework Steering Group
==============================================

* ZMI related code shall not be part of the Zope Framework, and we
  shall strive to remove it.

* If zope.deferredimport is used in a package merely to avoid the use
  of ``from`` imports, then instead we will use ``from`` imports to
  get rid of this dependency.
