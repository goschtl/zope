Version 0.2

  - Changed the UI to use images for elements and targets.

  - Added inline views.  You can now select templates to render objects.

  - Context menus now have headers.

  - The clipboard now works.

  - You can now define slots in a template using "slot:" expressions.
    This should make it easier to write templates.

  - The composite tool now checks copy/paste permissions before making
    any changes.

  - Slots now have a __str__ method, making it easy to render them
    directly.
