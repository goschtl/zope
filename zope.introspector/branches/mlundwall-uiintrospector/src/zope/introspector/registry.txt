:Test-Layer: functional

zope.interface provides the ``RegistryInfoUtility`` to search for and list all registered Utilities, 
Adapters, Handlers and SubscriptionAdapters. To list all registered Utilities::

  >>> from zope.introspector.interfaces import IRegistryInfo
  >>> from zope.component import getUtility
  >>> registryUtil = getUtility(IRegistryInfo)
  >>> registryUtil.getAllUtilities()
  [UtilityRegistration...]
  
The same thing can be done for Adapters::

  >>> registryUtil.getAllAdapters()
  [AdapterRegistration...]

For Handlers::

  >>> registryUtil.getAllHandlers()
  [HandlerRegistration...]
  
And for SubscriptionAdapters::

  >>> registryUtil.getAllSubscriptionAdapters()
  [...]

So far this has been empty.
Or you can get all registrations::

  >>> registryUtil.getAllRegistrations()
  [AdapterRegistration...]

However if you are looking for something special you can do a search in the registry to see if it registered.
So first we will create a Dummy utility so we have something to find when we search::

  >>> from zope.interface import Interface, implements
  >>> from zope.component import provideUtility
  >>> class IDummy(Interface):
  ...    pass
  >>> class Dummy(object):
  ...    implements(IDummy)

Now provide the Utility globaly::

  >>> provideUtility(Dummy, IDummy)

And use the RegistryInfoUtility to search for it::

  >>> registryUtil.getRegistrationsForInterface("Dummy")
  [UtilityRegistration(<BaseGlobalComponents base>, IDummy, u'', Dummy, u'')...]
  
Depending on what type of Registration that is searched different things are examined.    
Utilites you can search for either name of utility or provided interface.
Adapters you can search for name, provided interfaces, factory or required interfaces.
Handlers you can search for name, factory, or required interfaces.

There is also a way to get all registrations in a dictionary ordered by package name. 

  >>> registryUtil.getAllInterfaces()
  {...: {...: {...: {...: [...Registration...]}...}...}...}

This is mainly useful for browsing the complete component registry if you are not 
really sure what you are looking for.
