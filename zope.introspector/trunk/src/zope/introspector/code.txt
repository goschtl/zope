Code objects
============

The introspector represents code entities like packages, modules or
classes as ``Code`` objects. ``Code`` objects expect a dotted name to be
created::

  >>> from zope.introspector.code import Code
  >>> Code('zope.app')
  <zope.introspector.code.Code object at 0x...>

``Code`` objects do two things: they store the dotted name and
provide an ``IContext`` interface::

  >>> code = Code('zope.app')
  >>> code.dotted_name
  'zope.app'

  >>> from grokcore.component.interfaces import IContext
  >>> IContext.providedBy(code)
  True

The ``IContext`` marker interface helps us to associate ``Code``
objects with certain object types when adapters search for this.
