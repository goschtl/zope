Transforming schemas
====================

It is possible to transform schemas into other ones. The transformer 
facility follows the rule that schemas are immutable, but that other
schemas can be constructed out of old ones.

Let's take a simple schema::

  >>> from zope.interface import Interface
  >>> from zope import schema
  >>> class IFoo(Interface):
  ...     a = schema.Int(title=u'A')
  ...     b = schema.TextLine(title=u'B')
  ...     c = schema.TextLine(title=u'C')
  ...     d = schema.Int(title=u'D')

To transform the schema, we first need to wrap it into a transformer::

  >>> from zope.schema import transformer
  >>> ifoo_transformer = transformer(IFoo)

A transformer has a ``schema`` attribute indicating its schema::

  >>> ifoo_transformer.schema is IFoo
  True

Transformers define operations, and each returns a transformer. This
allows these operations to be chained.

Select
------

We can use the transformer to construct a new schema, selecting only
``a``, and ``b``::

  >>> selected_transformer = ifoo_transformer.select(['a', 'b'])

Out comes another transformer, with the transformed schema::

  >>> IFooSelect = selected_transformer.schema
  >>> from zope.schema import getFieldNamesInOrder
  >>> getFieldNamesInOrder(IFooSelect)
  ['a', 'b']

We can also reorder the fields in the schema this way::

  >>> reordered_transformer = ifoo_transformer.select(['d', 'c', 'b', 'a'])
  >>> getFieldNamesInOrder(reordered_transformer.schema)
  ['d', 'c', 'b', 'a']

We cannot select fields that do not exist::
 
  >>> ifoo_transformer.select(['z'])
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  KeyError: 'z'

Omit
----

We can also omit fields. This results in a new schema without the omitted
field. The order of the remaining fields is unaffected::

  >>> omitted_transformer = ifoo_transformer.omit(['a'])
  >>> getFieldNamesInOrder(omitted_transformer.schema)
  ['b', 'c', 'd']

We are free to omit fields that do not exist, as they aren't there anyway::

  >>> getFieldNamesInOrder(ifoo_transformer.omit(['z']).schema)
  ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

Override
--------

We can also override field properties. Let's say we want to modify the
title of the ``a`` field.

The title starts out as ``'A'``:

  >>> IFoo['a'].title
  u'A'

Now we override the title, producing a new schema::

  >>> s = ifoo_transformer.override('a', title=u'A overridden').schema
  >>> s['a'].title
  u'A overridden'

You can override any property, and also more than one, by using
keyword arguments.
  
Add
---

We can also add a field to the schema. Let's add a field ``z``. First
we need to create one::

  >>> z = schema.TextLine(__name__='z', title=u'Z')
  >>> s = ifoo_transformer.add(z).schema
  >>> getFieldNamesInOrder(s)
  ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'z']

Note that we have to set the __name__ manually in the field to be added. There
is a convenience for this::

  >>> z = schema.TextLine(title=u'Z')
  >>> s = ifoo_transformer.add(z, name='z').schema
  >>> getFieldNamesInOrder(s)
  ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'z']

We can also insert a field before another one::

  >>> s = ifoo_transformer.add(z, name='z', before='a').schema
  >>> getFieldNamesInOrder(s)
  ['z', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

  >>> s = ifoo_transformer.add(z, name='z', before='c').schema
  >>> getFieldNamesInOrder(s)
  ['a', 'b', 'z', 'c', 'd']
