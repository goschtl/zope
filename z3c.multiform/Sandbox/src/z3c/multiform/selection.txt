 Multiform Selections
======================

Selecting subforms of a multiform is a common task which is supported
by the multiform package. Selections are implemented by the ISelection
interface. This interface can be adapted to from objects which
implement IFormLocation which in turn can be adapted to from ILocation
and IForm. The IFormLocation adpater is a proxy which provides the
``__form_name__`` attribute.

The ISelection implementation in this package uses the request to
store the selection state, by using the ILocationForm interface.
