ldappas changes
===============

under development
=================

Features added
--------------

* Fixed Zope 3.3 induced deprecation warnings.

* principalInfo will try to look up a group if it cannot find a
  user. This is to make ldappas support groups in a minimal way. It is
  still the responsibility of the application to add LDAP-based groups
  to the principal (for instance by subscribing to the
  IAuthenticatedPrincipalCreated).


Bugs fixed
----------

Nothing yet.
