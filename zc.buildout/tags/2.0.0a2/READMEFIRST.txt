This is buildout 2, which is in an experimental state.  At this time,
buildout2 is primarily for existing buildout users who want to use
buildout with Python 3.

There is a new bootstrap script for this release at::

  svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zc.buildout/branches/2/bootstrap/bootstrap.py

To get it you can use::

  svn cat svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zc.buildout/branches/2/bootstrap/bootstrap.py

(Or use an ``svn`` external to the directory.)

or::

  wget http://svn.zope.org/*checkout*/zc.buildout/branches/2/bootstrap/bootstrap.py
