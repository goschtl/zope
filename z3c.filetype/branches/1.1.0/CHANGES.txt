Changes in z3c.filetype
=======================

After
=====

 - added interfaces for Microsoft office files
   Note : with the current magic.mimes file it is not possible to reliably
          detect Microsoft Office files. All Office files are detected as
          application/msword. The only way for now is to use the filename to
          detect the type. (see README.txt)
