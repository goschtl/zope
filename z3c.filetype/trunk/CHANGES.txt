1.2.2 (unreleased)
==================

 - Added documentation to ``long_description``.

 - Added license (ZPL 2.1).

 - Fixed tests to run with current package versions.

 - Using python's ``doctest`` package instead of deprecated
   ``zope.testing.doctestunit``.

1.2.1 (2009-04-20)
==================

 - Added a mime.types file for additional file extensions for pythons
   mimetypes module.

 - Added interface for WMA-Audio **Note:** with the current magic.mimes file
   it is not possible to detect WMA files. All WMA files are detected as
   video/x-ms-asf.  api.getInterfacesFor(filename='xxx.wma') can be used to
   detect files with extension "wma" as audio/x-ms-wma.

1.2.0 (2009-01-19)
==================

 - Added interfaces for Microsoft office files **Note:** with the current
   magic.mimes file it is not possible to reliably detect Microsoft Office
   files. All Office files are detected as application/msword. The only way
   for now is to use the filename to detect the type. (see README.txt)

1.1.1 (2007-12-21)
==================

   a year I reverted trunk to version 82160.
