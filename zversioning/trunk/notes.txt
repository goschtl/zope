Our default policy what is considered part of versioned object is:

  - all attributes that are defined in the schema declarations 
    at the time of writing to the repository (including the 
    directly provided ones) are considered to be part of the object
    by default.
    
    The existing mechanism to specify exception of this rule can be
    found in INonVersionedData
    
    XXX How to handle annotations? The current implementation only
    handles attributes.
    
  - Attributes that are not part of a schema declaration are not
    considered being part of the object all by default
    
    There will be an mechanism to specify what attributes shall be
    included.
