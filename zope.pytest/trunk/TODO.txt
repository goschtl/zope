TODO
====

* Tell how to build/use the docs stuff (including doc tests).

* Integrate sphinx docs:

  - Add docstrings for API in sources. [Done, although they might be
    more extensive/appropriate]

  - Give samples in docs (should be runnable with doctest builder).

  - Make docs better looking.
