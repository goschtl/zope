TODO
====

* the interact stuff could be removed entirely; it's useful for
  JSON testing but not particularly relevant to pytest integration.

* the @argument decorator should be removed again. This is a layer
  on top of pytest that we should discuss within the pytest project,
  and not do as an innovation in zope-land. Instead use  
  ``pyargs_funcarg__foo``, which is the standard pytest way to do it.

* it needs tests
