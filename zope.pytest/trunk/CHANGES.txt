0.2 (unreleased)
================

- Changed scope of `configure` from 'session' to 'function'. This
  guarantees proper test separation (ZCML registrations done in one
  test will not show up in another test). Drawback is that single
  tests are more expensive in setup/teardown resulting in longer test
  runs.

0.1 (2011-03-05)
================

Initial implementation.
