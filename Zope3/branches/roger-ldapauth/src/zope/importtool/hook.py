"""Low-level hook for __import__.

This allows a 'reporter' function to be installed that can report what
imports have occurred, possibly taking some action to block the import
(by raising an exception).

The reporter function is called with four arguments:

- the full name of the module performing the import,
- the full name of the module that was imported,
- the name by which the importer referenced the imported module (this
  may be a relative name rather than a full name), and
- the 'fromlist' argument passed to __import__().
