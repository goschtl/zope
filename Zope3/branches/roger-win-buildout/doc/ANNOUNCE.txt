Development release and feedback
--------------------------------

This is a development release with alpha quality. It is intended for developers
to check their applications for compatibility with the new features.

This release *is not intended to be used in production environments*.

We'd love to hear about any bugs you encounter. Please use our bug tracker, the
mailing lists, and the IRC channel to contact us in case you encounter any
problems.

This alpha release will be succeeded by a beta which is expected to be
available by 3rd May 2007.

What is Zope 3?
---------------

Zope 3 is a web application server that continues to build on the heritage of
Zope.  It was rewritten from scratch based on the latest software design
patterns and the experiences of Zope 2.

The component architecture is the very core of Zope 3 that allows developers to
create flexible and powerful web applications.


Compatibility with Zope 2
--------------------------

Zope 3 is not upwards compatible with Zope 2. This means you cannot run Zope 2
applications in Zope 3.

We continue to work on the transition from Zope 2 to Zope 3 by making Zope 2
use more and more of the Zope 3 infrastructure. This means that new code
written in Zope 2 can benefit from Zope 3 technology. Also, with care, code
can be written that works in both Zope 3 and Zope 2.  This allows a Zope 2
application to slowly evolve towards Zope 3.  Unchanged Zope 2 applications
are never expected to work in Zope 3, however.


New features and important changes
----------------------------------

XXX 

There were many more features, restructurings and bugs fixed. Please consult
the file `doc/CHANGES.txt` in the release for more information.
