ToDo List for Twisted Integration
=================================

* Implement graceful shutdown, including KeyboardInterrupt.

* Forms do not work. :( This is absolutely critical!

* Set the thread count. Itamar suggested having our own thread pool.

* Use configuration information to create servers.

* Use old server-type utility code to generate servers.

* Have information being displayed on the screen upon server start.

* Display log on screen. In general, we need to do logging based on the info
  from zope.conf.
