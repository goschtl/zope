ToDo List for Twisted Integration
=================================

* Implement graceful shutdown, including KeyboardInterrupt.

* Set the thread count. Itamar suggested having our own thread pool.

* Use configuration information to create servers.

* Use old server-type utility code to generate servers.

* Have information being displayed on the screen upon server start.

* Display username in logs. In general, we need to do logging based on the info
  from zope.conf.

* We need to get an FTP server working. FTP is a long-supported protocol and
  we cannot have a Zope 3 version without it.
