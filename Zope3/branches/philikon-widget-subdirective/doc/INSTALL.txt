Building and installing Zope from source
----------------------------------------

  This document describes building and installing Zope3 on Unix.
  We will provide Windows instructions in later releases. We
  will also provide binary releases for some platforms.

Important notes

   ZOPE 3 REQUIRES PYTHON 2.3.5!

Quick Start

  The following commands should get you up and running with the
  development version of Zope3 on Unix:

    * If you have not yet checked out the Subversion tree, do so::

         svn co svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/Zope3/trunk/ Zope3

    * cd Zope3

    * python setup.py build_ext -i

      (On Unix, typing "make" will do the same thing.)

    * Copy sample_principals.zcml to principals.zcml, and edit the
      entries in your new principals.zcml.  At the very least, change
      the passwords!

    * python z3.py

      (On Unix, typing "make run" will do the same thing.)

  You should shortly see logging messages indicating Zope3 is listening on
  port 8080.  At that point you can connect to Zope3 by directing
  your browser to::

     http://yourhost:8080/manage

  where yourhost is the name or address of the machine running Zope 3.

  This will access the Zope 3 default management interface.  Note that
  this release of Zope 3 requires recent versions of Mozilla or IE.

  If you insist on using an older browser (or a text-based browser)
  you can use the basic Zope 3 skin by putting '++skin++Basic' after
  the server part of the URL::

    http://localhost:8080/++skin++Basic/manage

  You will be prompted for a user name and password. Use the user name
  and password you entered into your principals.zcml file.

  Now you're off and running!

Resources

  If you haven't used Zope3 before, you should head to the Zope web
  site and read some documentation. The Zope 3 Python Programmers
  Tutorial is a good place to start.  You can access it on the Zope
  site at::

    http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/ProgrammerTutorial

  You will also find some additional documentation in the 'doc'
  directory of the Zope3 tree, where this file lives.  All other
  existing Zope3 documentation is linked from somewhere in the Zope
  project Wiki::

    http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/ComponentArchitecture

  You may also want to subscribe to the Zope3-dev mailing list::

  Have fun!

Random Details

    * There are some Python scripts in the top-level directory that
      will help you track changes during the development process.
      Specifically, 'setup.py' helps you build the extension modules,
      and 'test.py' will run all of the unit tests (see UNITTEST.txt
      in the doc directory for more information on unit tests).

    * You should be using Python 2.3.5 or later to run anything
      related to Zope3.

    * The Python you run Zope with *must* have threads compiled in.
      This is typically the case for a vanilla build on platforms that
      support thread, but be sure this wasn't disabled if you use a
      custom build.  (If the Python statement "import thread" raises
      an exception, your Python interpreter does not support threads.)
      Warning: Zope will not run with a Python version that uses
      libpth.  You *must* use libpthread.

    * To build Python extensions you need to have Python configuration
      information available. If your Python comes from an RPM you may
      need the python-devel package installed too. If you built Python
      from source all the configuration information should already be
      there.

    * If you just want to use Zope components it's not necessary to
      build Zope but it's a good idea since it will compile Python C
      extensions for you.

Troubleshooting

    * We've seen segfaults when running the test suite.  This was
      invariably caused by having parts of Zope 2 or ZODB 3 (which
      goes with Zope 2) installed in site-packages or elsewhere on
      Python's module search path (sys.path).  So make sure you have
      no parts of Zope 2 or ZODB 3 on sys.path when running Zope 3!
