===================
The Boston ZMI Skin
===================

The Boston skin is experimental work right now. Feel free to write comments,
ideas and wishes to the zope3-dev mailinglist. 

We will try different concepts on this skin. The main target whould be to get
a open customizable skin that can be used as a Rotterdam
alternative/replacement by deveopers.

Requirements
-------------

  - Offer a concept for registering aditional javascripts

  - Offer a concept for registering additional CSS style sheets

  - Offer a concept for registering own boxes under the navigation
  
  - Works in newer browser on each plattform, especially linux, windows, mac

  - Works in newest version of the following browsers: IE, firefox (gecko),
    Safari (KHTML/KJS)


Dont's
------

  - Must not work on older browsers, new technologies are fine but have to 
    support the plattform and browsers described above.

  - Must not support accessibility requirments. It's not a enduser skin.
    Please let me know, if somebody needs this. If so, we can implement a
    seperate ZMI skin for supporting fully accessibility support.


Miscellaneous
-------------

  Different ideas of the Boston skin where born on the IRC with Stephan
  Richter.  It's usual to name a skin like the town where the skin was
  born. We decide to name it Boston because Stephan lives there.
