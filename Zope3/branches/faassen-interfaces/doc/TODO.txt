============================================================
Things to do for the next release (sorted by importance)
============================================================

- Distribution, packaging an installation system.  Fred is working on
  a prototype. This will eventually inclide Zope-2 style installation,
  configuration and process management.

- http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/NoMoreSchemaBinding

- http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/SupportingConstraintMaintainingSubscriptions

  This is needed for a number of other tasks.  Nathan Yergler is
  working on this.

- Redo event service

  o Simplify publication/registration framework

  o Subscribe directly, rather than by path

  Note that, for now, we won't support local subscriptions.

- Change the way components are looked up locally:

  http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/FixedDefaultComponentLookup

- Finish location-relevent event work;
  specifically, handling events on containers.  

  See: http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/LocationRelatedEvents

- Persistent interfaces cannot be provided as providedBy or implementedBy
  interfaces anymore. This functionality was broken during some interface and
  adapter refactorings. Originally this was out of scope, but I think it is
  too important and fundamental to be left out.
