Things to do for the next release (in no particular order)
==========================================================

Miscellaneous
-------------

- Ensure backward compatibility

  o Run book sources against source tree (Stephan and Phillip)

- Separate the loading of the meta-ZCML from the configuration ZCML,
  so that an application can load all the meta without loading any
  configuration, so gaining control over what configuration gets
  loaded.


Bug Fixes
---------

Bugs starting with * represent bugs that must be fixed for the 3.0.x branch as
well .
