Issues
======

We have removed some functionality that will need to be added back
some day:

- When an index is added, it can be updated with data for 
  hub-registered objects.

Other issues:

- When someone changes index paramters, like the interface or field
  name, then the index should be cleared and either rebuilt, or the
  user should be give the opportunity to rebuild it.

- The interfaces and browser code for the three indexes should be
  distributed to those subpackages. Perhaps these subpackages should
  become peers of zope.app.index.
