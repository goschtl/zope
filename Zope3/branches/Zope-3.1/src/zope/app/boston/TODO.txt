- Change slotbox layout macros to tables, because they don't expand the width
  correctly in pure <div> CSS layout

- Add JS for nested menu support

- Integrate preferences for individual user settings.

  Possible preferences are:

  - static or xml tree

  - navigation width of left slot

  - order of boxes in left slot

  - status of a box (collapsed or expanded)
