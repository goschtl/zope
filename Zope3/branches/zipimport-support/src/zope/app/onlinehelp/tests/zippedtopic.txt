Loading help topics from ZIP archives
=====================================

Help topics, like many types of resources, can be offered by packages
imported from ZIP archives.  The harness for this test adds a ZIP file
containing the "onlinehelp_test" package, which provides a single help
topic.  We'll load the topic via the help system to demonstrate that
this works::

  >>> print http("""
  ... GET /++help++/@@contexthelp.html HTTP/1.1
  ... """, handle_errors=False)
  HTTP/1.1 200 ...
  ...<a href="/++help++/onlinehelp_test">Online Help Test Topic</a...

We can now select our topic to see our sample help text::

  >>> print http("""
  ... GET /++help++/onlinehelp_test HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 ...
  ...This is the test online help topic...
  ...There isn't much text here...
