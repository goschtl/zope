Publishing views from ZIP archives
==================================

Python packages can be imported from ZIP files.  Zope supports using
such packages as extension providers: ZCML can be loaded from them and
they can provide views based on templates or other data contained
inside the archive.

This document demonstrates this facility.  The Python harness for this
test (test_zipped.py) has added a ZIP file containing a sample package
to sys.path, and loaded ZCML that loads a view from that package.

Since the ZCML has already been loaded, we can check that our view is
available::

  >>> print http("""
  ... GET /@@sometext.html HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 ...
  <div>(This is some text.)</div>

This is the text provided by the view class in in the `sampleview`
package's __init__.py, wrapped in the <div> element from the myview.pt
template also contained in that package.
