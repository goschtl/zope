Zope 3 has been a Zope Community effort!  It wouldn't exist without
the many fine contributions, in many forms, by many people.  In fact,
so many people have helped out in so many important it's impossible to
give everybody the credit they deserve, but I'll make a start.

Sprints
-------
  
A good bit of the Zope 3 development has taken place in Zope 3
sprints. 

- The earliest sprints were held at Zope Corporation. Tres Seaver
  was instrumental in helping us figure out this format and
  teaching me the XP process.

- Chris Withers and NIP hosted the first European sprint in
  London in February 2002.

- Alastair Burt hosted a workflow sprint in Saarbruecken, Germany,
  in March 2002. 

- NetAid (Josh Kutz, Nikheel Dhekne) hosted a sprint in New York
  in March 2002.

- Beehive hosted a sprint in Berlin in April 2002.

- EuroPython/EuroZope hosted a large sprint in conjunction with
  the EuroPython conference.

- ZeOmega hosted an extended development session in Bangalore.
  We worked out a number of ideas for the (still early) through
  the web configuration and development environment.  We moved
  file-system synchronization forward. And we ported several
  facilities from Zope 2.

- Infrae (Kit Blake, Martijn Faasen and others) hosted a truly
  amazing and productive event, the Infrae Sprintathon,
  http://www.infrae.com/sprintathon, in December 2002. I think
  that this qualifies as the first Zope 3 Hackers Workshop. I hope
  there will be more.

- Code Works hosted a sprint, led by Steve Alexander, in Vilnius,
  immediately after the sprintathon.

- Solutions Linux hosted a UI sprint, led by Paul Everitt and 
  Sidnei da Silva.
  
- The German Zope User's Group hosted a sprint in conjunction with the
  DZUG meeting in Berlin in March 2003.  

- Godefroid Chapelle hosted a sprint at Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium in
  April 2003. 

- Matt Hamilton and Bristol University hosted a sprint in Bristol
  in April 2003.

- Zope Corporation hosted a sprint in F12b in early June 2003.

- Zope Corporation hosted a sprint in F12b in late June 2003.

- OzZope in combination with several sponsors held a sprint at the Trinity
  College at the Melbourne University.

Other Contributions
-------------------

  o Steve Alexander has provided tremendous leadership, along with his
    many other contributions, in design, code, to say nothing of moral
    support. 

  o Stephan Richter helped launch Zope 3 with abundant energy and
    enthusiasm, as well as many software and documentation contributions. 

  o Shane Hathaway created some of the initial prototypes of Zope 3
    and was an important brainstorming partner before we went "public"
    with Zope 3. He has remained a stalwart but quiet contributor,
    despite his heavy workload at Zope Corporation.

  o Python Labs: Guido van Rossum, Fred Drake, Jeremy Hylton, Tim
    Peters, and Barry Warsaw have been crucial contributors to Zope 3
    since it was just a bunch of stray ideas floating around.

  o Gary Poster has made significant contributions in a variety of
    areas, including the object hub and event service.

  o David Murray has been a constant source of well-thought feedback,
    suggestions, and ideas. 

  o Sidnei da Silva created the first attractive skin for Zope 3. 

  o Kapil Thangavelu, David Murray, Sidnei da Silva, and PythonLabs
    made the grand renaming possible. Kapil wrote the scripts that did
    most of the work and the team made Zope work again.

  o The folks at Codeworks, Albertas Agejevas, Marius Gedminas, and
    Viktorija Zaksiene and contributed major parts of Zope, especially
    the relational database support and caching infrastructure. Much
    thanks to M Carling for making their time available.

  o Much thanks to Alexander Limi, Alan Runyan, Godefroid Chapelle,
    Joachim Werner, Paul Everitt, and others for the "Rotterdam Skin",
    the default skin in Zope 3.  Special thanks to Godefroid
    for the finishing work just before the alpha.


Much thanks!
