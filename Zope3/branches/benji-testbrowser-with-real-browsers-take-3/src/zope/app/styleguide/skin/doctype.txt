Doctype
=======

The Zope3 default skin follows the XHTML 1.0 Transitional DTD

::

  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">


But Zope3 is already almost XHTML Strict

::

  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">

So developers and web designers should code as if pages follows already XHTML 
Strict.

The doctype has to be at the first line of the page template. Without any 
other tag. Don't use encoding tags in front of a doctype.
