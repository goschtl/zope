- Decide where we should place the style guide. I think the source zope.app 
  is the right place, because we can include it in the onlinehelp.
  
- Chechout if the online help works and include it in a own section
  like 'skins.???'

- Remove CSS test skin

  Test skin "CSS" (just for prototyping) is located in src.css.browser
  You can call it like::

  http://localhost:8080/++skin++CSS

  I've added a temporary test skin "CSS" in ./skin. We will remove it
  after defining the style sheet. The new style sheet will be used in the
  Rotterdam skin or the replacement of the Rotterdam later.

  The default (Rotterdam) skin should use the zope3.css file in this
  package. This way we can support one place where we have to update.

  That's also the reason why this pakage is here and not in the 
  zope.doc.

- Search for used styles and add it to the following files:

  o samples.html
  o zope3.css
  
  We can copy paste it form the rotterdam skin. But check each
  css tag. Perhaps we have obsolate tags in the rotterdam css
  since we never did take care on it

- Review text and correct Roger's swiss-german-english typos

Bugs (seen in Rotterdam skin)
-----------------------------

- Fix resizing of left navigation, the navigation cuts long words

- Fix long menues (zmi_actions), they get lost on the white background if
  they get rendered in a second line below the blue bar
