There is a test skin based on rotterdam for testing the new zope3.css
file located in this package. You can access the skin with:

::

  http://localhost:8080/++skin++CSS

The test skin "CSS" will be removed after defining all styles.
The default skin (actually rotterdam) should use the default
css file zope3.css after clean up this package.
