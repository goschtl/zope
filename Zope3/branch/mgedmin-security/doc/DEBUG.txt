Using the Zope Debugger

  Introduction
  
    Zope3 includes a mechanism to debug an object publishing request, 
    similar to the Zope2 
    "debug mechanism":http://www.zope.org/Members/mcdonc/HowTos/UsingTheZopeDebugger

  Setting up Environment

    Setup your PYTHONPATH environment variable to include
    src. ie (unix bash syntax)::

      cd Zope3
      export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src:$PYTHONPATH
    
    To start interacting with the debugger you need to initialize the
    zope application::

      $ python2.3
      >>> from zope.app import Application
      >>> app = Application('path/to/zodb/', 'path/to/site.zcml')
            
  Using the Debugger

    There are several methods you can call on the application object
    for testing purposes.

    Publish 

      The 'publish' method executes a request as the publisher would
      and prints the response headers and body::

         >>> app.publish(path='/folder/content_object')

    Run

      The 'run' method executes a request with the publisher's normal 
      error handling disabled and without outputting anything.  This is
      useful for use with Python's post-mortem.

         >>> app.run(path='/folder/content_object')
         # an exception is raised
         >>> import pdb; pdb.pm()
         # enters the python post-mortem debugger

    Debug
      
      The 'debug' method starts up the publisher in the python
      debugger, with an extra convenience break point, setup just before
      the published object call::

        >>> app.debug(path='/folder/content_object')
        * Type c<cr> to jump to published object call.
        pdb> 
      
    Arguments

      All of the application object's debug methods take optional
      arguments, the more common/useful ones...

      - path - the url path to debug

      - basic - user:password used for HTTP basic auth (it will be
        base64 encoded by the debug method).

  Accessing objects (without the debugger)

    You can use the application object to open a database connection
    to access your objects.  If the application object is called, it
    opens a database connection and fetches the root object::

       root = app()

    For example, to list the objects in the root folder:

       print list(root)

    Also note that, after initializing the application, by creating
    the root object, you can access any global services setup during
    initialization.
