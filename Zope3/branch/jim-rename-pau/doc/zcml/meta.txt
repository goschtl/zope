The Meta Configuration System
-----------------------------

Meta configuration is the configuration of the configuration system.
In the case of zcml, this means using the "metaconfiguration" zcml
configuration directives to define the configuration directives that
will actually be used to configure the system.

An overview of the meta-configuration system can be found in
src/zope/configuration/README.txt.

Instructions for creating simple configuration directives can be found
in src/zope/configuration/tests/test_simple.py.
