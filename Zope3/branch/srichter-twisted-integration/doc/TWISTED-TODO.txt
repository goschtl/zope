ToDo List for Twisted Integration
=================================

* Display username in logs. In general, we need to do logging based on the info
  from zope.conf.

  - Push logging to Zope App Server.

* We need to get an FTP server working. FTP is a long-supported protocol and
  we cannot have a Zope 3 version without it.

* SSL HTTP support. Client certificate validation.
