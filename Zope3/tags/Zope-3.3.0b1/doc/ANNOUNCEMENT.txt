Release Date: May 8, 2006

The Zope 3 development team is proud to announce Zope 3.3.0 beta 1.

Zope 3 is the next major Zope release and has been written from scratch based
on the latest software design patterns and the experiences of Zope 2.

Cleanup of the Zope 3 packages has continued to ensure a flexible and
scalable platform. We continued the work on making the transition from Zope 2
to Zope 3 by making Zope 2.10 use even more of the Zope 3 packages. But we're
not there yet. **You can't run Zope 2 applications in Zope 3.**


Downloads

  http://zope.org/Products/Zope3

  Installation instructions for both Windows and Un*x/Linux are now available
  in the top level "README.txt":http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope3/3.3.0b1/README.txt
  file of the distribution. The binary installer is recommended for Windows.

  Zope 3.3 requires Python 2.4.1 to run. You must also have zlib
  installed on your system.

Most Important Changes Since 3.2

  - Provided a new component registry API that allows multiple
    component registries to be combined more flexibly than before.
    See 'zope.component.interfaces.IComponentRegistry' for more
    information.

  - Greatly simplified local-component registration.
    See 'zope.component.interfaces.IComponentRegistry' for more
    information.

  - Moved many packages out of zope.app to make them easier to use
    outside of Zope.

  - Change the session credentials plugin to make it configurable
    in which fields it looks for the credentials.

  - Added a new API for collating text.  You can now adapt
    a locale to 'zope.i18n.interfaces.ILocales.ICollator'.  You can
    then use that to sort strings, such as menu entries, in a
    locale-specific fashion.

  - A new 'zope.annotation.factory' helper function that makes
    it easier to create annotations. Also added a README in
    'zope.annotation' which explains how to use it.

  - Added a more complete set of widgets for fields that use
    iterable sources.  These widgets now mirror the set provided
    by vocabulary-based fields.

  - Added a cleaner and more robust API to testbrowser for setting
    file-upload data.


  - Deprecated several ZCML directives:

    * factory

    * vocabulary

    * content (as an alias to the class directive)

    * modulealias

    * renderer:renderer

  - The 'browser:layer' directive and the 'ILayer' interface
    has been deprecated.  Registering layers has become obsolete,
    layers should be created as interfaces extending
    'IBrowserRequest'.

  - The 'browser:skin' directive has been deprecated.  Skins
    should be created as interfaces extending 'IBrowserRequest'
    and can be registered using a simple 'utility' directive.

  - The 'ISkin' interface has been renamed to 'IBrowserSkinType'.

  For a complete list of changes see the 'CHANGES.txt' file.
