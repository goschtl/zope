  - Add functional tests


Rendering/Views

  - Create custom HTMLDocument class for rendering the STX and ReST in Wiki
    style.

  - Make sure WebDAV works.

  - Add File Extension recognition.

  - Create a Management screen (advancedform) that is accessible for users
    without management rights.


Other Features

  - Make use of Traverser features; i.e. create links that include
    parents...

  - Check in Traverser that found subobj has self.context as parent.

  - Activating diff support for edited Wiki Pages. The main issue right now
    is to get to the old version of the text. so that we can execute the
    Differ.

  - Update POT and translations

  - Allow for multiple parents. The WikiPageHierarchyAdapter.path() method
    only returns the path of a wiki and not all the possible paths it has.

  - Make use of indices in search, once they are back in the core again.
