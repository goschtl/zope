Passwd Principal Authentication Source Demo Product

  This product is developed as an example for the Zope 3 Cookbook. You can
  find the text at http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/DevelCookbook. Therefore the
  product will never be considered feature complete and look like a very crude
  product. However, it demonstrates nicely the necessary steps that have to be
  taken to create a principal authentication source.

  IMPORTANT: Please do not edit any of the code (except adding comments)
             unless you are willing to make the correct modifications in the
             corresponding recipe as well!

  Feel free to send comments to srichter@cosmos.phy.tufts.edu.
