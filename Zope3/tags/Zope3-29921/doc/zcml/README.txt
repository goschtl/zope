ZCML Directives Documentation
=============================

Documentation on ZCML directives available is available from a running
Zope 3 instance.

To read the documentation, you must be able to visit the management
pages of the server::

    http://zope.example.com/manage

Select the "Help" action (to the right on the actions menu in the
default skin); this will open a new window.  Select "API Docs" to
bring up another window; this new window will contain the
documentation browser you're looking for.  It contains three panes.
In the upper-left pane, select "ZCML Reference".  A tree providing
access to specific directives will be shown in the lower-left pane;
select a specific directive to see detailed documentation in the right
pane.
