19 April 2007 - The Zope 3 development team announces the Zope 3.4.0a1 release

This release introduces support for binary large objects in the ZODB, provides
a new postprocessing hook for publishing results and makes all Zope packages
available as Python eggs.

Development release and feedback
--------------------------------

This is a development release with alpha quality. It is intended for developers
to check their applications for compatibility with the new features.

This release *is not intended to be used in production environments*.

We'd love to hear about any bugs you encounter. Please use our bug tracker, the
mailing lists, and the IRC channel to contact us in case you encounter any
problems.

This alpha release will be succeeded by a beta which is expected to be
available by 3rd May 2007.

What is Zope 3?
---------------

Zope 3 is a web application server that continues to build on the heritage of
Zope.  It was rewritten from scratch based on the latest software design
patterns and the experiences of Zope 2.

The component architecture is the very core of Zope 3 that allows developers to
create flexible and powerful web applications.


Compatibility with Zope 2
--------------------------

We continue to work on the transition from Zope 2 to Zope 3 by making Zope 2
use more and more of the Zope 3 packages. But we're not there yet. **You can't
run Zope 2 applications in Zope 3.**


New features and important changes
----------------------------------

- Updated the shipped ZODB to version 3.8 and introduced optimized handling for
  large files in  conjunction with ZODB Blob support. Most Blob operations can
  be handled with O(1) effort now providing a scalable approach to handling
  large files.

- Introduced IResult hook for postprocessing of publishing results.  This
  replaces a similar private IResult hook from previous releases.  It is a hook
  point into which a variety of interesting policies, including in-Zope
  pipelining, can be placed.  See zope/publisher/httpresults.txt for more
  details, which itself points to the full details for IResult and
  IHTTPResponse.setResult in zope/publisher/interfaces/http.py.

- zope.app.testing.functional.ZCMLLayer supports in-process tearDown.  For
  backwards compatibility, this feature is disabled by default.  You can enable
  it by passing ``allow_teardown=True`` to ``ZCMLLayer()`` or to
  ``defineLayer()``.

- Removed unused and untested SFTP code from zope.app.twisted along with all
  the SSH keys. Removed all the SSL keys also.

- Added new Decimal field type to zope.schema (and DecimalWidget in
  zope.app.form) and added security declarations for decimal.Decimal objects

- Added new Time field type to zope.schema

- Change the publication object to abort the current transaction if the
  transaction was doomed. Related to:

There were many more features, restructurings and bugs fixed. Please consult
the file `doc/CHANGES.txt` in the release for more information.
