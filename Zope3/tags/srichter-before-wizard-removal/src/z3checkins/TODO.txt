I definitely want to do the following:

- Make sure non-ASCII chars work both in headers and in bodies

I'm not sure I'll find time for these:

- Is storing all the messages in a single folder scalable enough?
- Highlight branch tags in message body
- Highlight quoted text in normal message bodies
- Show checkin times in the user's timezone instead of server's (this probably
  needs some configuration page and cookies)
- Replace newlines with <br/> elements in checkin messages in message_part.pt
- Shorten descriptions in message_part.pt to first 100 chars (words? sentences?
  lines?)
- Add links to the specific versions of the files mentioned in the CVS web
  interface
- Filtering (by branch, by author, etc)
- Threading?
- Verify how all this works in other browsers beside Mozilla
