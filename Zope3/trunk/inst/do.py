# 7. Modifications are encouraged but must be packaged separately as
#    patches to official Zope releases.  Distributions that do not
#    clearly separate the patches from the original work must be clearly
#    labeled as unofficial distributions.  Modifications which do not
#    carry the name Zope may be packaged in any form, as long as they
