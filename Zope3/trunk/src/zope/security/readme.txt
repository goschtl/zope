Zope3 Security

  Introduction

    The Security framework provides a generic mechanism to implement
    security policies on Python objects.  This introduction provides a
    tutorial of the framework explaining concepts, design, and going
    through sample usage from the perspective of a Python programmer
    using the framework outside of Zope.

  Definitions

    Principal

     A generalization of a concept of a user.  A principal may be
     associated with different roles and permissions.

    Permission

     A kind of access, i.e. permission to READ vs. permission to
     WRITE.  Fundamentally the whole security framework is organized
     around checking permissions on objects.

    Roles

     Represents a responsibility of a user in the context of an
     object.  Roles are associated with the permissions necessary to
     fulfill the user's responsibility.

  Purpose

    The security framework's primary purpose is to guard and check
    access to Python objects.  It does this by providing mechanisms
    for explicit and implicit security checks on attribute access for
    objects.  Attribute names are mapped onto permission names when
    checking access and the implementation of the security check is
    defined by the security policy, which receives the object, the
    permission name, and a context.

    Security contexts are containers of transient information such as
    the current principal and the context stack.

    To explain the concept and usage of the context stack, a little
    background into the design influences of the default Zope policy
    is needed, namely the Java language security model.  Within the
    base language, code is associated with identifiers. I.e. this code
    came from "Joe Schmoe", and another code archive comes signed from
    Verisign.  When executing restricted code, it's important access
    is checked not only for the code currently executing but for the
    entire call/context stack (unless explicitly short-circuited).
    I.e.  if Joe Schmoe's code does haven't access to the filesystem,
    but if the Verisign code does, Joe's code could circumvent the
    security policy by accessing the filesystem via the Verisign code.

    Its important to keep in mind that the policy provided is just a
    default, and it can be substituted with one which doesn't care
    about principals or context stacks at all.

  Framework Components

    Low Level Components

      These components provide the infrastructure for guarding
      attribute access and providing hooks into the higher level
      security framework.

      Checkers

        A checker is associated with an object kind, and provides the
        hooks that map attribute checks onto permissions deferring to
        the security manager (which in turn defers to the policy) to
        perform the check.

        Additionally, checkers provide for creating proxies of objects
        associated with the checker.

        There are several implementation variants of checkers, such as
        checkers that grant access based on attribute names.

      Proxies

        Wrappers around Python objects that implicitly guard access to
        their wrapped contents by delegating to their associated
        checker.  Proxies are also viral in nature, in that values
        returned by proxies are also proxied.

    High Level Components

      Security Management

        Provides accessors for setting up security manager and global
        security policy.

      Security Context

        Stores transient information on the current principal and the
        context stack.

      Security Manager

        Manages security context (execution stack) and delegates
        permission checks to security policy.

      Security Policy

        Provides a single method that accepts the object, the
        permission, and the context of the access being checked and is
        used to implement the application logic for the security
        framework.

  Narrative (agent sandbox)

    As an example we take a look at constructing a multi-agent
    distributed system, and then adding a security layer using the
    Zope security model onto it.

    Scenario

      Our agent simulation consists of autonomous agents that live in
      various agent homes/sandboxes and perform actions that access
      services available at their current home.  Agents carry around
      authentication tokens which signify their level of access within
      any given home.  Additionally agents attempt to migrate from
      home to home randomly.

      The agent simulation was constructed separately from any
      security aspects.  now we want to define and integrate a
      security model into the simulation.  The full code for the
      simulation and the security model is available separately; we
      present only relevant code snippets here for illustration as we
      go through the implementation process.

      For the agent simulation we want to add a security model such
      that we group agents into two authentication groups, "norse
      legends", including the principals thor, odin, and loki, and
      "greek men", including prometheus, archimedes, and thucydides.

      We associate permissions with access to services and homes.  We
      differentiate the homes such that certain authentication groups
      only have access to services or the home itself based on the
      local settings of the home in which they reside.

      We define the homes/sandboxes

        - origin - all agents start here, and have access to all
          services here.

        - valhalla - only agents in the authentication group 'norse
          legend' can reside here.

        - jail - all agents can come here, but only 'norse legend's
          can leave or access services.


    Process

      Loosely we define a process for implementing this security model

      - mapping permissions onto actions

      - mapping authentication tokens onto permissions

      - implementing checkers and security policies that use our
        authentication tokens and permissions.

      - binding checkers to our simulation classes

      - inserting the hooks into the original simulation code to add
        proxy wrappers to automatically check security.

      - inserting hooks into the original simulation to register the
        agents as the active principal within a security manager's
        context....

    Defining Permission Model

      We define the following permissions::

       NotAllowed = 'Not Allowed'
       Public = Checker.CheckerPublic
       TransportAgent = 'Transport Agent'
       AccessServices = 'Access Services'
       AccessAgents = 'Access Agents'
       AccessTimeService = 'Access Time Services'
       AccessAgentService = 'Access Agent Service'
       AccessHomeService = 'Access Home Service'

      and create a dictionary database mapping homes to authentication
      groups which are linked to associated permissions.

    Defining and Binding Checkers

      Checkers are the foundational unit for the security framework.
      They define what attributes can be accessed or set on a given
      instance.  They can be used implicitly via Proxy objects, to
      guard all attribute access automatically or explicitly to check a
      given access for an operation.

      Checker construction expects two functions or dictionaries, one
      is used to map attribute names to permissions for attribute
      access and another to do the same for setting attributes.

      We use the following checker factory function::

         def PermissionMapChecker(permissions_map={},
                                  setattr_permission_func=NoSetAttr):
             res = {}
             for k,v in permissions_map.items():
                 for iv in v:
                     res[iv]=k
             return Checker.Checker(res.get, setattr_permission_func)

         time_service_checker = PermissionMapChecker(
                                        # permission : [methods]
                                        {'AccessTimeService':['getTime']}
                                        )

      with the NoSetAttr function defined as a lambda which always
      return the permission NotAllowed

      To bind the checkers to the simulation classes we register our
      checkers with the security model's global checker registry::

         import sandbox_simulation
         from Zope.Security.Checker import defineChecker
         defineChecker(sandbox_simulation.TimeService, time_service_checker)

    Defining a Security Policy

      We implement our security policy such that it checks the current
      agent's authentication token against the given permission in the
      home of the object being accessed::

      class SimulationSecurityPolicy:

          __implements__ = ISecurityPolicy

        def checkPermission(self, permission, object, context):

            token = context.user.getAuthenticationToken()
            home = object.getHome()
            db = getattr(SimulationSecurityDatabase, home.getId(), None)

            if db is None:
                return False

            allowed = db.get('any', ())
            if permission in allowed or ALL in allowed:
                return True

            allowed = db.get(token, ())
            if permission in allowed:
                return True

            return False

      There is some additional code present to allow for shortcuts in
      defining the permission database when defining permissions for
      all auth groups and all permissions.

    Integration

      At this point we have implemented our security model, and we
      need to integrate it with our simulation model.  We do so in
      three separate steps.

      First we make it such that agents only access homes that are
      wrapped in a security proxy.  By doing this all access to homes
      and services (proxies have proxied return values for their
      methods) is implicitly guarded by our security policy.

      The second step is that we want to associate the active agent
      with the security context so the security policy will know which
      agent's authentication token to validate against.

      The third step is to set our security policy as the default
      policy for the Zope security framework.  It is possible to
      create custom security policies at a finer grained than global,
      but such is left as an exercise for the reader.

    Security Manager Access

      The *default* implementation of the security management
      interfaces defines security managers on a per thread basis with
      a function for an accessor.  This model is not appropriate for
      all systems, as it restricts one to a single active user per
      thread at any given moment.  Reimplementing the manager access
      methods though is easily doable and is noted here for
      completeness.

    Perspectives

      It's important to keep in mind that there is a lot more that is
      possible using the security framework than what's been presented
      here.  All of the interactions are interface based, such that if
      you need to re-implement the semantics to suite your application
      a new implementation of the interface will be sufficient.
      Additional possibilities range from restricted interpreters and
      dynamic loading of untrusted code to non Zope web application
      security systems.  Insert imagination here ;-).

    Zope Perspective

      A Zope3 programmer will never commonly need to interact with the
      low level security framework.  Zope3 defines a second security
      package over top the low level framework that implements concepts
      of roles, and authentication sources and checkers are handled
      via zcml registration.  Still those developing Zope3 will
      hopefully find this useful as an introduction into the
      underpinnings of the security framework.
