# This is used by the Zope 3 packaging tool to support construction of
# the zope.app portion of the Zope 3 distribution.  This file is used
# to specify which files and directories should be included in the
# distribution of the zope.app package itself; many of the child
# packages will be separate components that can be added by larger
# distributions.
#
# This file does *not* define any Zope 3 distribution, only the
# zope.app package itself.
#
# (Most packages won't need such elaborate packaging metadata; zope
# and zope.app are truly special cases.)
