<!--
configure is the root element of the ZCML file.

Besides enclosing the rest of the directive, you define some
namespaces on it in the standard XML namespaces way.

xmlns="uri" defines the default namespace elements are in (when they
don't use the 'foo:bar' notation).

xmlns:foo="uri" defines another namespace. You can put elements in
that namespace by using the defined prefix ('foo:bar').

i18n_domain="hellopackage" defines the internationalization (i18n)
domain for this package
-->
<configure
   xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
   xmlns:browser="http://namespaces.zope.org/browser"
   xmlns:global_translation="http://namespaces.zope.org/gts"
   i18n_domain="hellopackage"
   >

<!--
Declaration of a content object.

This is defined by HelloClass in hellomodule.
-->
<class class=".hellomodule.HelloClass">
  <implements 
      interface="zope.app.annotation.interfaces.IAttributeAnnotatable"
      />

  <!--
  More information about making new Hello objects.

  id is used later to refer to it in the add menu. Permission is
  used to restrict who is allowed to add Hello objects.
  -->
  <factory
      id="hellopackage.Hello"
      title="Hello world"
      description="A simple hello world object."
      />

  <!--
  Permissions on using Hello objects.

  We specify which permission is needed to use attributes. We can have
  more of these, and attributes can be a list as well ('foo bar baz')
  -->
  <require
      permission="zope.View"
      attributes="getHello"
      />
</class>

<!--
Create a hello.html view for Hello object.

The view has a name (index.html), it applies to ZMI tab called (View)
and it applies to an interface (interfaces.IHello). The view is made
from a page template called hello.pt. Only people with the 'Zope.View'
permission may use this view.
-->
<browser:page
    for=".interfaces.IHello"
    name="index.html"
    menu="zmi_views"
    title="View"
    template="hello.pt"
    permission="zope.View"
    />

<!--
Add the Hello object to the add menu.

'factory' refers to the id of the factory that creates new hello world
objects.

'title' is what will show up in the add menu as the name of the
object. 'description' will show up as a description in the add menu as
well.
-->
<browser:addMenuItem
    factory="hellopackage.Hello"
    title="Hello world"
    description="An object for hello worlding."
    />
