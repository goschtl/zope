========================
Object Introspector View
========================

The "Introspector" view provides access to information about the class
that implements an object and the interfaces that the object provides
directly.

::

  >>> response = str(http("""
  ... GET /@@introspector.html HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic mgr:mgrpw
  ... """))

  >>> print response
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

The class information is provided as a link from the class name to the
introspection page for the class::

  >>> ("http://localhost/++apidoc++/Code/"
  ...  "zope/app/folder/folder/Folder/index.html") in response
  True
  >>> "zope.app.folder.folder.Folder" in response
  True

Information about the directly provided information is provided by
links from the provided interface names to the introspection pages for
the interfaces::

  >>> ("http://localhost/++apidoc++/Interface/"
  ...  "zope.app.component.interfaces.ISite/apiindex.html") in response
  True
  >>> ">zope.app.component.interfaces.ISite</" in response
  True

  >>> ("http://localhost/++apidoc++/Interface/"
  ...  "zope.app.folder.interfaces.IRootFolder/apiindex.html") in response
  True
  >>> ">zope.app.folder.interfaces.IRootFolder</" in response
  True
