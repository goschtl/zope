The Boston skin is experimental work right now. Feel free to write comments,
ideas and wishes to the zope3-dev mailinglist. 

We will try different concepts on this skin. The main target whould be to get a 
open customizable skin where can be used as a ZMI Rotterdam replacement 
used by deveopers. 

Requirements
-------------

  - Offer a concept for register aditional javascripts

  - Offer a concept for register additional CSS style sheets

  - Offer a concept for register own boxes under the navigation
  
  - Works in newer browser on each plattform, this are linux, windows, mac

  - Works in newest version of the following browsers, IE, firefox(gecko),
    Safari

Dont's
------

  - Must not work on older browsers, new technologies are fine but have to 
    support the plattform and browsers described above.

  - Must not support accessibility requirments. It's not a enduser skin.
    Please tell me if somebody need this. Id so, we can implement a own ZMI skin
    for supporting fully accessibility support.

  Different ideas of the Boston skin where born on the IRC with Stefan Richter.
  It's usual to name a skin like the town where the skin was born. We decide to 
  name it Boston because Stefan lives there.
