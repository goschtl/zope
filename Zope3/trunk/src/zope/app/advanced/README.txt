Advanced
========

The advanced package adds a XML based factory distribution system to
Zope 3. In order to do this, an advanced query mechanism (see
query.py) had to be implemented.

This ultimately finishes Zope2 backward compatability for Zope3. In
addition, advanced XML abilities were added as a nice side effect.
