Sessions allow us to fake state over a stateless protocol - HTTP. We do this
by having a unique identifier stored across multiple HTTP requests, be it
a cookie or some id mangled into the URL.

ISessionService provides this unique id. ISessionDataManagers attach data
objects of some sort to a specific session id. This data object may be
a Persistent ZODB object, or an object that stores data in a RDBMS using
the session id as the key.

ISessionDataManagers are registered with ISessionServices using a name,
which ought to be unique for each application. Thus you can have multiple
data objects registered with a single session.

ISessionServices may choose to expire sessions. In this case they
should notify all ISessionDataManagers registered with them and
invalidate the attached data objects. Likewise ISessionDataManagers
probably want to expire data.
