class RegistrationStack(Persistent, Contained):
    """Registration registry implemention

       A registration stack provides support for a collection of
       registrations such that, at any time, at most one is active.  The
       "stack" aspect of the api is designed to support "uninstallation",
       as will be described below.

       Registration stacks manage registrations.  They don't really care
       what registrations are, as long as they can be activated and
       deactivated:

         >>> class Registration(object):
         ...
         ...     def __init__(self, name):
         ...         self.name = name
         ...         self.active = False
         ...
         ...     def __repr__(self):
         ...         return self.name
         ...
         ...     def activated(self):
         ...         self.active = True
         ...
         ...     def deactivated(self):
         ...         self.active = False

       We create a registration stack by providing it with a parent:

         >>> stack = RegistrationStack(42)
         >>> stack.__parent__
         42

       If a stack doesn't have any registrations, it's false:

         >>> bool(stack)
         False

       And it has no active registration:

         >>> stack.active()

       We can register a registration:

         >>> r1 = Registration('r1')
         >>> stack.register(r1)

       and then the stack is true:

         >>> bool(stack)
         True

       But we still don't have an active registration:

         >>> stack.active()

       Until we activate one:

         >>> stack.activate(r1)
         >>> stack.active()
         r1

       at which point, the registration has been notified that it is
       active:

         >>> r1.active
         True

       We can't activate a registration unless it's registered:

         >>> r2 = Registration('r2')
         >>> stack.activate(r2)
         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         ValueError: ('Registration to be activated is not registered', r2)

         >>> stack.register(r2)
         >>> stack.activate(r2)

       Note that activating r2, deactivated r1:

         >>> r1.active
         False

       We can get status on the stack by calling it's info method:

         >>> for info in stack.info():
         ...     print info['registration'], info['active']
         r2 True
         r1 False

       So why is this a stack? Unregistering an object is a bit like
       popping an element. Suppose we unregister r2:

         >>> stack.unregister(r2)

       Whenever we unregister an object, we make the object that was
       previously active active again:

         >>> stack.active()
         r1

         >>> r1.active
         True

       Now, let's deactivate r1:

         >>> stack.deactivate(r1)
         >>> stack.active()
         >>> r1.active
         False

       And register and activate r2:

         >>> stack.register(r2)
         >>> stack.activate(r2)
         >>> stack.active()
         r2

       Now, if we unregister r2:

         >>> stack.unregister(r2)

       We won't have an active registration:

         >>> stack.active()

       Because there wasn't an active registration before we made r2
       active.

class NotifyingRegistrationStack(RegistrationStack):
    """Notifying registration registry implemention

       First, see RegistrationStack.

       A notifying registration stack notifies both the registration
       *and* the stacks parent when it changes.  It notifies the
       parent by calling nothingActivated and notifyDeactivated:

         >>> class Parent(object):
         ...
         ...     active = deactive = None
         ...
         ...     def notifyActivated(self, stack, registration):
         ...         self.active = registration
         ...
         ...     def notifyDeactivated(self, stack, registration):
         ...         self.active = None
         ...         self.deactive = registration


       To see this, we'll go through the same scenario we went through
       in the RegistrationStack documentation.
       A registration stack provides support for a collection of

         >>> class Registration(object):
         ...
         ...     def __init__(self, name):
         ...         self.name = name
         ...         self.active = False
         ...
         ...     def __repr__(self):
         ...         return self.name
         ...
         ...     def activated(self):
         ...         self.active = True
         ...
         ...     def deactivated(self):
         ...         self.active = False

       We create a registration stack by providing it with a parent:

         >>> parent = Parent()
         >>> stack = NotifyingRegistrationStack(parent)

       We can register a registration:

         >>> r1 = Registration('r1')
         >>> stack.register(r1)

       But we still don't have an active registration:

         >>> stack.active()
         >>> parent.active

       Until we activate one:

         >>> stack.activate(r1)
         >>> parent.active
         r1

       if we activate a new registration:

         >>> r2 = Registration('r2')
         >>> stack.register(r2)
         >>> stack.activate(r2)

       The parent will be notified of the activation and the
       deactivation:

         >>> parent.active
         r2
         >>> parent.deactive
         r1

       If we unregister r2, it will become inactive and the parent
       will be notified, but whenever we unregister an object, we make
       the object that was previously active active again:

         >>> stack.unregister(r2)
         >>> parent.active
         r1
         >>> parent.deactive
         r2

       Now, let's deactivate r1:

         >>> stack.deactivate(r1)
         >>> parent.active
         >>> parent.deactive
         r1

       And register and activate r2:

         >>> stack.register(r2)
         >>> stack.activate(r2)
         >>> parent.active
         r2

       Now, if we unregister r2:

         >>> stack.unregister(r2)

       We won't have an active registration:

         >>> parent.active
         >>> parent.deactive
         r2

       Because there wasn't an active registration before we made r2
       active.
