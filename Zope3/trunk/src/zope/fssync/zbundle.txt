Security Notes
--------------

- The ``@@Zope/Root`` file contains the username and password with
  which the checkout was made.  Since this will typically allow access
  with content management priviledges, this file should not be shared
  carelessly.


Files
-----

**zbundle** does not create any supplemental files beyond what
**zsync** produces.  Refer to the **zsync** documentation for details
on those files.


Reporting Bugs
--------------

Bugs in **zbundle** and the filesystem synchronization support in Zope 3
should be reported via the `Zope 3 Development Issue Collector`__, an
online reporting tool that allows you to enter reports directly into
our bug-tracking system.

There are two interesting and directly relevant articles in the `Zope 3
wiki`:

* The |FSSYNC|_ is the initial proposal for a way to synchronize
  copies of a Zope-based website between a filesystem-based
  representation and the database backing the live site.

* Bundles are discussed in |TTWSITE|_; this gives more information on
  the motivation and goals surrounding this work.
