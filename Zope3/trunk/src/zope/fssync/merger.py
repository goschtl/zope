"""Class to do augmented three-way merges.

class Merger(object):
    """Augmented three-way file and directory merges.

    An augmented merge takes into account three files (or directories)
    and two metadata entries.  The files are labeled local, original,
    and remote.  The metadata entries are for local and remote.  A
    remote metadata entry is either empty or non-empty.  Empty means
    the file does not exist remotely, non-empty means it does exist
    remotely.  We also have to take into account the possibility that
    the existence of the file belies what the entry declares.  A local
    metadata entry can have those states, and in addition, if
    non-empty, it can be flagged as added or removed.  Again, the
    existence of the file may bely what the entry claims.  The
    original file serves the obvious purpose.  Its existence, too, can
    be inconsistent with the state indicated by the metadata entries.

    To find the metadata entry for a file, we look for a key
    corresponding to its basename @@Zope/Entries.xml in the directory
    that contains it.  For this purpose, we assume the filename given
    uses the correct case even on a case-insensitive filesystem (i.e.,
    the filesystem must be at least case-preserving).

    The purpose of the merge() function is to merging the remote
    changes into the local copy as the best it can, resolving
    inconsistencies if possible.  It should not raise an exception
    unless there are file/directory permission problems.  Its return
    value is an indicator of what it dit.

    The classify() function is a helper for merge(); it looks at all
    the evidence and decides what merge() should do, without actually
    touching any files or the metadata.  Possible actions are:

    Fix      -- copy the remote copy to the local original, nothing else
    Copy     -- copy the remote copy over the local copy
    Merge    -- merge the remote copy into the local copy
                (this may cause merge conflicts when tried)
    Delete   -- delete the local copy
    Nothing  -- do nothing

    The original file is made a copy of the remote file for actions
    Fix, Copy and Merge; it is deleted for action Delete; it is
    untouched for action Nothing.

    It should also indicate the final state of the local copy after
    the action is taken:

    Conflict -- there is a conflict of some kind
    Uptodate -- the local copy is the same as the remote copy
    Modified -- the local copy is marked (to be) modified
    Added    -- the local copy is marked (to be) added
    Removed  -- the local copy is marked (to be) removed
    Spurious -- there is an unregistered local file only
    Nonexistent -- there is nothing locally or remotely

    For Conflict, Added and Removed, the action will always be
    Nothing.  The difference between Removed and Nonexistent is that
    Nonexistent means the file doesn't exist remotely either, while
    Removed means that on the next commit the file should be removed
    from the remote store.  Similarly, Added means the file should be
    added remotely on the next commit, and Modified means that the
    file should be changed remotely to match the local copy at the
    next commit.

    Note that carrying out the Merge action can change the resulting
    state to become Uptodate or Conflict instead of Modified, if there
    are merge conflicts (which classify() can't detect without doing
    more work than reasonable).

        preserved when the database is written back (not by the Merger
        class).  To delete all metadata for a file, call the dict's
        clear() method.

        We pass in the metadata database rather than inheriting from
        it, in part because this makes testing with a Mock metadata
