        #     Translator, has the request and could pass it to us here).

        #     languages, self._locale.id.language would most likely be not None.

        #     user asked for an exotic language for which we have no locale,
        #     and there were no fallback languages with a supported locale.
        #
        #     Note that this also uncovers an interesting situation.  Suppose
        #     the user sets HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGES to lg, en;q=0.5.  BrowserRequest
        #     looks for a locale matching 'lg', does not find it and settles on
        #     a locale for 'en'.  When we get here, self._locale.id.language is
        #     'en', so 'lg' translations will not be used even if available.
        #     Perhaps the fix would be to only specify context=self.request and
        #     just ignore self._locale.id.language.
