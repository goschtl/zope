Installation
============

  - Since Wiki is not enabled by default, you need to include the Wiki
    package in your instance's configuration.  Create
    $INSTANCE_HOME/package-includes/zwiki-configure by copying the file
    package-includes/zwiki-configure.zcml from the Zope repository, or create
    it with the following contents::

    <include package="zwiki" />

  - You need to define the following role declarations to your user in order
    to use the wiki package effectively::

    <grant role="zwiki.Admin" principal="user" />
    <grant role="zwiki.Editor" principal="user" />
    <grant role="zwiki.User" principal="user" />

    <grant role="zwiki.User" principal="anybody" />

Usage
=====

  1. To see Wikis in action, go into the management interface and add a Wiki
     object named 'wiki'. Leave the two preselected options.

  2. To enter the end user interface, enter::

      http://localhost:8080/++skin++wiki/wiki
