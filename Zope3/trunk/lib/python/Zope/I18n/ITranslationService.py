    """The Translation Service

    This interface provides methods for translating text, including text with
    interpolation.

    When we refer to text here, we mean text that follows the standard Zope 3
    text representation.

    Standard arguments in the methods described below:

        domain -- The domain is used to specify which translation to use.
                  Different products will often use a specific domain naming
                  translations supplied with the product.

                  A favorite example is: How do you translate "Sun"?  Is it
                  our star, the abbreviation of Sunday or the company?
                  Specifying the domain, such as "Stars" or "DaysOfWeek" will
                  solve this problem for us.

        msgid -- The id of the message that should be translated.  This may be
                 an implicit or an explicit message id.

        mapping -- The object to get the interpolation data from.

        target_language -- The language to translate to.

        context -- An object that provides contextual information for
                   determining client language preferences.  It must implement
                   or have an adapter that implements IUserPreferredLanguages.

        Note that one of target_language or context must be passed.  Otherwise
        a TypeError will be raised.

        Also note that language tags are defined by RFC 1766.

                  context=None, target_language=None):
        """Return the translation for the message referred to by msgid.

        However, the method does a little more than a vanilla translation.
        The method also looks for a possible language to translate to.
        After a translation it also replaces any $name variable variables
        inside the post-translation string.
        
        Note: The TranslationService interface does not support simplified
        translation methods, since it is totally hidden by ZPT and in
        Python you should use a Domain object, since it supports all
        the simplifications.
