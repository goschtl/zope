"""Standard interfaces for using the query service.

The query service provides a set of interfaces for articulating queries. You
can create complex queries by implementing multiple interfaces like
IBatchedQuery and ITextIndexQuery to ask the TextIndex for a batched query.
The lookup for the query processor will try to find an appropriate adapter to
the index.
