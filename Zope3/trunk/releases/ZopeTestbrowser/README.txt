============================
The Zope Testbrowser Package
============================

This is a separate distribution of the zope.testbrowser package used in
Zope 3, along with the packages it depends on.

This package is a standard distutils package; build it with the command:

    python setup.py build

You can now install it with:

    python setup.py install

You may need to do the later as a priviledged user.
