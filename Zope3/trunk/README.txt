============================
Welcome to the Zope 3 source
============================

This file provides some basic hints for people developing Zope 3 software.
There is more developer info in the Zope 3 Wiki::

  http://wiki.zope.org/Zope3/Zope3DeveloperInfo

For information about the current release, see ``doc/CHANGES.txt``.

Zope 3 is a stable platform on which production systems can and are built.


Building and running tests
==========================

See ``INSTALL.txt`` which Python version is required for Zope 3.

In the top-level ``Zope3`` directory, you should find a script called
``setup.py``.  Run it to build the extension modules needed by Zope.  Example::

    $ cd Zope3
    $ python setup.py -q build_ext -i install_data --install-dir .

On a Unix variant, you can just type::

    $ make

On Windows, if you downloaded the binary distribution, this has already been
done for you (since the compiler we use on Windows isn't free).

Zope 3 includes unit tests based on the Python ``unittest`` module.  If you
check in changes, you *must* verify that all the tests succeed before you
commit changes.

To run all the tests, use the script test.py::

    $ python test.py -v

Use ``test.py -h`` for usage.  The test script can run selected tests, stop
after the first error, run the tests in a loop, etc.


Starting Zope 3
===============

Before running Zope, you need to create one or more bootstrap users.  Copy the
file ``sample_principals.zcml`` to ``principals.zcml``, and edit the result to
your needs.  Make sure you change the passwords.

To run Zope just run the ``z3.py`` script::

    $ python z3.py

Or, if you use make on Unix, you can run::

    $ bin/zopectl fg

This will run Zope on port 8080.  Visit the url::

    http://localhost:8080/manage

This goes to the Zope 3 default management interface.  Note that this release
of Zope 3 requires recent versions of Mozilla or IE.  Note that other modern
browsers, such as Konqueror and Safari, also mostly work well.

If you insist on using an older browser (or a text-based browser) you can use
the basic Zope 3 skin by putting ``++skin++Basic`` after the server part of
the URL::

    http://localhost:8080/++skin++Basic/manage

See ``doc/INSTALL.txt`` for more information.


Finding out how to develop applications
=======================================

There are several documentation sources out there. As of this writing two
books have been published and much online documentation is available:

- Zope 3 comes with an extensive API documentation tool, which also compiles
  many of the package-specific README files. Once you start up Zope, simply go
  to::

    http://localhost:8080/++apidoc++
