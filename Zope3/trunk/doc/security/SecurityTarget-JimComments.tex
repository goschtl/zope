\chapter{ST Introduction}

This chapter presents security target (ST) identification information and an
overview of the ST. The ST contains the information technology (IT) security
requirements of an identified Target of Evaluation (TOE) and specifies the
functional and assurance security measures offered by that TOE to meet stated
requirements. An ST principally defines:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A security problem expressed as a set of assumptions about the
    security aspects of the environment, a list of threats that the TOE is
    intended to counter, and any known rules with which the TOE must comply
    (Chapter ``TOE Security Environment'').

    \item A set of security objectives and a set of security requirements to
    address the security problem (Chapters ``Security Objectives'' and ``IT
    Security Requirements'').

    \item The IT security functions provided by the TOE that meet the set of
    requirements (Chapter ``TOE Summary Specification'').
\end{itemize}

The structure and content of this ST complies with the requirements specified
in the Common Criteria (CC), Part 1, Annex C, and Part 3, chapter 5.

\section{ST identification}

This section provides information needed to identify and control this ST and

\section{ST overview}

The Target of Evaluation is Zope 3.3 in its non-default ``secure''
configuration (hereinafter called Zope for simplicity), a general purpose, open
source web application server and framework. It is used as a runtime
environment for custom applications that are build using the Zope 3 API and
component library.

Zope clients are standards conformant web browsers using HTTP or other network
client programs accessing the various network services provided by Zope. The
secure configuration for this evaluation considers only the use of the HTTP
server. Other network service components exist but are out of scope for this
evaluation.

Zope includes security functionality on three levels: 1. the definition of
permissions and privileges, and the mapping of permissions to privileges by
developers and administrators, 2. the definition of users and groups and
granting privileges to them for various objects by administrators and 3. the
enforcement of those permissions during the runtime when an application is
beeing used.

***Jim
This three-level breakdown is a tad odd.  I don't think I sawit
referenced later.


A summary of the TOE security functions can be found in Chapter ``TOE
description''. A detailed description of the security functions can be found in
chapter ``TOE Summary Specification''

%___________________________________________________________________________

\section{CC conformance}

This ST is CC Part 2 conformant and CC part 3 conformant at the level of
assurance EAL 1.


%___________________________________________________________________________



\chapter{TOE description}

This chapter provides context for the TOE evaluation by identifying the product
type and describing the evaluated configuration.

%___________________________________________________________________________


\section{Product type}

Zope's primary purpose is to provide an environment for running custom web
applications and their components. Additionally it provides a software library
and tools to support the development of new applications.

Zope is written as platform independent software using the Python programming
language. Therefore it is available for Windows, Linux, MacOS X and other
operating systems. The platform supported within this evaluation is Linux. 

% purpose one: running applications
The core functionality contains a web server with WebDAV support, an FTP server
and an XML/RPC server. It has components that provide functionality for
security management including administration of users, groups and privileges.
Other core components cover an object database, indexing mechanisms, workflow,
a web interface, SQL support, an XML-based and a non-XML based templating
mechanism, Python scripting, internationalization and localization support and
many more.

Zope is built with a flexible component architecture that allow the core system
to be extended by re-using components and adding new components based on
defined interfaces. This includes extending the server to support new network
services, authentication schemata, access to new relational databases and many
more while maintaining integrity within the core system.

% purpose two: building applications
Historically, Zope is used for building content management systems but is also
widely and successfully used to build web applications in the general sense.

Custom Zope applications are written as packages that can contain configuration
directives, templates, and Python code and classes. Those packages are intended
to work together seamlessly using the component architecture to plug them
together into more complex systems.

\section{Physical scope and boundary of the TOE}

The TOE  is physically described by the release files that are made available
on zope.org. For general supported platforms this is a set of source files and
utilities to compile and install Zope. 

The complete product consists of several independent software packages that can
be described as high-level components (not to be confused with the term
"component" in Zope's own sense):

***Jim
The last half of the sentance above seems unnecessary.


\begin{enumerate}

\item Developer API, to define permissions and privileges, to map permissions
to privileges, and to declare what components of an application are protected
by which permission. 

\item Zope Object Database (ZODB), a transparent persistency layer that stores
Python objects into an object database. The ZODB manages a logical and physical
view on the data and allows for the use of a database server (Zope Enterprise
Objects, ZEO) to connect a cluster of multiple identical Zope servers to a
single database server. The ZODB supports typical enterprise-class functions
like transactions, undo and clustering, yet it does not care for security on
the programming level. Typically the ZODB is used as the central storage for
application data, but can be accompanied by RDBMS or be replaced totally. The
use of additional or replacement data sources is not part of the evaluation.

***Jim
Is it necessary to mention undo?  We should not include undo in the ST.
(We should explicitly omit it.)


\item Software library, allowing developers to build their own applications
based on Zope. Zope itself is formed by combining many components from this
library into a single program.  These components are also offered for
re-use outside of cope and for extension by developers.

\item Network component, for providing an HTTP server to access Zope and the
applications running inside Zope from a web browser.

\item Pluggable Authentication Utility (PAU), that, based on the credentials
presented through the network component, authenticates and identifies users for
a request to the Zope server. The PAU is part of the software library.

\item A protection component, that regulates access to application components
and assures that a user has the correct privileges granted for a component
before executing component accesses (getting attributes or setting attributes).
The access is regulated with a ``privilege-based access policy''.

\item A publication component, that connects requests from the network
component with the application objects. The publication component also connects
the request with the authentication utility and the protection component to
establish the security environment for a request.

\end{enumerate}

%___________________________________________________________________________


\subsection{Logical scope and boundary of the TOE}

The TOE logical boundary is defined by the following security-relevant
subsystems provided by the TOE:

\begin{description}

  \item[Protection] mediates each access to object attributes and methods and
  consults the authorization subsystem to decide whether to allow an access or not.

  \item[Authentication] uses information made available by a client request to
  authenticate a user for a request.

  \item[Authorization] manages privilege grants and implements a method to
  check whether a user was granted a privilege or not. It is consulted by the
  protection subsystem.

  \item[Auditing] receives and logs events through Zope 3's event system that
  are security relevant.

  \item[Transaction Management] provides ACID compatible transactions to secure
  the object database's state between multiple concurrent requests 

  \item[Publication / Server] provides a central entry point into the Zope 3
  process through multiple network services. The publication creates an
  internal representation of the network request and connects it with the
  protection subsystem, authentication subsystem and transaction management.

\end{description}

See section \vref{toe-sec-funcs} for more details regarding those sub-systems.

\section{Assets}

The following primary assets have been identified:

\begin{longtable}[c]{lp{10cm}}
  \toprule 
  Asset Name & Description \\
  \midrule\endhead

  (Content) Objects & 
  Generic objects (instances of Python classes) that
  are stored and controlled by Zope and carry
  information that is to be protected. Objects are
  stored in a connected manner that is typically
  hierarchical and allows the derivation of
  information by the objects context. \\
  \bottomrule
  \caption{Primary Assets}
  \label{tab-assets}
\end{longtable}

The following secondary assets have been identified:

***Jim
I don't know what the magic tex characters are doing below so I'll just
stay outa there. :)  Shouldn't Host System be a primary asset?  It's
one I tend to care about most.


\begin{longtable}[c]{lp{10cm}}
  \toprule 
  Asset Name & Description \\
  \midrule\endhead
  Host System
   &
  The unit of computer hardware and software that forms the environment of Zope
  to run on. Typically a PC server with Linux installed.
   \\

  Operations
   & 
  Operations are the way of accessing and modifying
  data provided by (content) objects.
   \\

  Principals
   & 
  Principals are the systems representation of acting
  individuals. A principal acts in behalf of the user
  and represents a (content) object of its own.
   \\

  Permission
   & 
  A permission is a name guarding an operation.
   \\

  Privilege
   &
  A privilege is a collection of permissions, grouped under a given name.
  \\\

  Privilege grants
   & 
  A privilege grant associates a principal (user or group) with a
  privilege that allows them to perform all operations that are 
  protected by permissions that belong to the granted privilege in the context
  of the grant.
   \\

  Audit data
   & 
  The data generated by the TOE audit subsystem.
   \\

  Transaction data
   & 
  All operations within Zope are held within ACID
  compatible transactions that are bound to each
  request from the outside and associated with a
  principal.
  \\
  \bottomrule
  \caption{Secondary Assets}
  \label{tab-sec-assets}

\end{longtable}
%___________________________________________________________________________

\section{Subject}

Zope has a concept of interactions, which model the interaction of one or more
users with the system.  An interaction keeps track of the users that are
participating in the interaction as ``participations''.  In the TOE,
interactions will have single users participating through Web requests
Special scenarios include not associating an
interaction with any participation at all (running on system level) or
associating an interaction with multiple participations, e.g. to include the
author of code stored in the system and the user running it.

In the terminology of common criteria, those interactions are the ``subjects''
causing operations within the TOE to be performed.

%___________________________________________________________________________

\section{Operations}

Operations are performed on objects. They are defined in an object's class. A
class is defined in the Python programming language and is identified by a
fully qualified name.

***Jim
Is it worth noting that a (very) few classes are implemented in C?

An operation is a name defined in a class. It may take a form of an attribute
or a method.

There are two possible kinds of access to an operation: reading, such as reading
an attribute or calling a method, and writing, such as setting or deleting an
attribute. Reading and writing can be guarded using different permissions.

Operations in the Zope terminology match the definition and use of
``operations'' in the terminology of common criteria.

\section{Permissions and privileges}

The access control policy includes a model of permissions and privileges.

Attributes and methods are protected by permissions, defined by a developer of
a component.

Privileges are defined by system administrators. Privileges are defined by a
bit number, a title and a description. There exist 3 default privileges:

\begin{itemize}
    \item bit=``0'', title=``Read'', description=``Read content''
    \item bit=``2'', title=``Write'', description=``Write content''
    \item bit=``4'', title=``Share'', description=``Share content (grant privileges)''
\end{itemize}

All even-numbered bits are reserved for allocation by the Zope system for
future use, all odd-numbered bits are free to be used by other parties.

A permission is mapped to a privilege by the system administrator, giving the
permission identifier and the bit number of the privilege. Multiple permissions
can be mapped to the same privilege.

Users can be granted privileges on individual objects that support sharing.
This is called ``sharing information''.

When a new object is added without sharing information, initial sharing
information will be applied by copying over the applicable sharing information
of the parent object and granting all applicable privileges to the creator(s).

\section{Supporting sharing}

XXX better place to put this definition to?

Objects may support "`sharing'' by implementing the ISharing interface (or providing
an adapter to ISharing)

***Jim
You should probably mention what happens to objects that are not adaptable to ISharing.
BTW, did you define adaptation anywhere? :)


%___________________________________________________________________________

\section{Assumptions (about the environment)}

The following assumptions need to be made about the TOE environment:

\begin{longtable}[c]{lp{10cm}}
  \toprule
  Assumption Name & Description \\
  \midrule

  A.OS & The machine and the operating system Zope is running on is physically
  secure. The system is administered such that the system is free from
  malicious software, such as viruses and Trojan horses. The operating system
  provides a true system clock. \\

  A.Admin & 
  The ``system-administrator'' of the above
  mentioned machine is competent and trustworthy.
   \\

  A.Network & 
  A network connection to the Zope services is
  present. All other network connections to the same host are
  secure in a way that the integrity of
  the host and operating system is preserved.
   \\

  A.Client & 
  The connection between client and Zope server is
  secure in a sense that the identification and
  authentication data is not monitored or interfered with. This can either be
  through the use of a private network or a secure channel using an SSL proxy
  with an encryption mechanism of at least 128-Bit RSA.
  \\

  A.Credential & 
  The user is keeping the credential to authenticate
  secret. \\

  \bottomrule
  \caption{Assumptions about the TOE environment.}
  \label{tab-A}
\end{longtable}

%___________________________________________________________________________



\section{Threats}

The following threat agents have been identified:

\begin{itemize} 
  
  \item Users having correct authentication credentials who might try to
  acquire more permission grants to get access to operations they should not.

  \item Users without correct authentication credentials for a certain
  principal trying to authenticate as this.

\end{itemize}

Additional threat agents with specific motivation, resources and skills have to
be identified for any specific application built using Zope 3. From the point
of a generic application server, attackers are either to be expected to  be
authenticated and trying to extend their level of access or not having been
authenticated at all and trying to break into the system.

The following threats against the assets have been identified:

\begin{longtable}[c]{lp{6cm}p{4cm}}
  \toprule
  Threat & Description & Asset\\
  \midrule\endhead

  T.IA
   & 
  An attacker might impersonate an authorized
  principal without providing the necessary
  credentials.
   & 
  Principal

  T.Perm
   & 
  A principal changes the permission grants
  without having the right to do so.
   & 
  Permission grants
   \\
  

  T.Operation
   & 
  A principal performs an operation on an object
  without having the correct permission.
   & 
  Operation, Object
   \\
  

  T.AuditFake
   & 
  An attacker might convince the audit data
  generation functions to log false information
  (date, time, type of event, outcome, user)
   & 
  Audit data
   \\
  

  T.RIP
   & 
  An attacker might try to make the system use
  residual information for deciding to allow
  or deny access to an operation to gain more
  access than intended.
   & 
  Secondary assets
   \\
  

  T.Transaction
   & 
  An attacker might try to perform commit or
  abort operations on foreign transactions to
  perform operations on the behalf of other
  users.
   & 
  All assets in ZODB
   \\
  
  T.Timestamps
   & 
  An attacker might try to hide his actions
  by making the system create false timestamps
  which would result in wrong association to a
  user on dynamic IP address ranges.
   & 
  Audit data
   \\
  

  T.Host
   & 
  An attacker might use Python functions that
  result in direct access to the host environment
  therefore compromising the host and Zope itself.
   & 
  Host, Object
  \\

\section{Organisational security policies}

OSPs are to be defined by the developer who creates applications using Zope and
the customer running those applications.  Zope as a general purpose application
server does neither require nor impose any OSPs.


%___________________________________________________________________________



\chapter{Security objectives}


%___________________________________________________________________________



\section{Security objectives for the TOE}

The following security objectives have been defined for the TOE:

\begin{longtable}[c]{lp{10cm}}
  \toprule
  Objective Name & Description \\
  \midrule\endhead
  
  O.IA
   & 
  All principals must be accurately identified and
  authenticated with the exception of the ``unauthenticated''
  principal.
   \\

  O.Delegation
   & 

  Provide the ability to securely delegate control. Principals that are granted
  the ``Share'' privilege shall be able to grant or revoke privileges to/from
  other principals.
  
  A special group of system administrators can be configured using ZCML to
  create a set of initial users that have all privileges granted, including the
  ``Share'' privilege.
  \\

***Jim
Note that these adminstrors can have permissions that can't be granted.
These users have all permissions and not all permissions need be mapped to privileges.


  O.Audit
   & 
  The TOE will provide the means of recording any
  security relevant events, so as to assist an
  administrator in the detection of potential attacks
  or misconfiguration of the TOE security features
  that would leave the TOE susceptible to attack, and
  also to hold users accountable for any actions
  they perform that are relevant to security.
   \\

  O.Protect
   & 
  The TOE will protect itself against external
  interference or tampering by untrusted subjects or
  attempts by untrusted subjects to bypass the TOE
  security functions.
   \\

  O.Access
   & 
  The TOE ensures that access to objects is always
  mediated by operations and guarded by permissions.
   \\

  O.Integrity
   & 
  Whenever an unhandled error within the context of a
  running transaction occurs (related or unrelated
  to security) the transaction will be rolled back
  and the system will be in the state before the
  transaction started.
   \\

  O.Attributes &  All security attributes (e.g. principal or permission
    identifiers) together must form a consistent, meaningful whole at all times. \\

  O.ManageRisk
   & 
  Provide the ability to manage risk by trading off functionality against risk.
  For example, we can make it easier to access the system to perform operations
  whose potential negative impact is low, but make it more difficult to access
  the system in a way that allows operations with high negative impact.
  (Especially timed authentification and identification allow to provide
  functions to unauthenticated or unidentified users with the option to
  identify or authenticate as soon as the user wants to use a more critical
  function.)
  \\
  \bottomrule
  \caption{Security Objectives for the TOE}
\end{longtable}

***Jim
Has anyone implemented time-based auth?


%___________________________________________________________________________



\section{Security objectives for the environment}

The following security objectives have been defined for the TOE environment:

\begin{longtable}[c]{lp{10cm}}
  \toprule
   Objective for the environment & Description \\
  
  \midrule\endhead

  OE.OS
   & 
  The machine and the operating system Zope is running
  on is physically secure.
   \\

  OE.Trust
   & 
  Those responsible for the TOE must be trustworthy.
   \\

  OE.Auditlog
   & 
  Administrators of the TOE must ensure that audit
  facilities are used and managed effectively. In
  particular:

  \begin{itemize}
  
    \item Appropriate action must be taken to ensure continued audit logging,
    e.g. by regular archiving of logs before audit trail exhaustion to ensure
    sufficient free space.

    \item Audit logs should be inspected on a regular basis, and appropriate
    action should be taken on the detection of breaches of security, or events
    that are likely to lead to a breach in the future.

  \end{itemize}
   \\

  OE.Network
   & 
  A network connection to the Zope services is present.
  All other network connections are secure in such a
  way that the integrity of the machine and operating
  system is preserved.
   \\

  OE.Client
   & 
  The connection between client and Zope server is secure
  in the sense that the identification and authentication
  data is not monitored or interfered.
   \\

  OE.Credential
   & 
  The user is keeping the credentials to authenticate
  secret.

\section{TOE security requirements}


%___________________________________________________________________________



\subsection{TOE security functional requirements}

The following functional requirements identify the TOE functional requirements.
They have been drawn from the CC Part 2 functional requirements components.


%___________________________________________________________________________



\subsubsection{Class FAU: Audit data generation}


%___________________________________________________________________________



\minisec{FAU{\_}GEN.1 Audit data generation}
\begin{description}
  
  \item[FAU\_GEN.1.1] The TSF shall be able to generate an audit record of the
  following auditable events:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Startup and shutdown of audit functions; and
      \item all auditable events for the \emph{minimum} level of audit.
  \end{itemize}

\item[FAU{\_}GEN.1.2]

The TSF shall record within each audit record at least the
following information:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Date and time of the event, type of event, subject identity,
and the outcome (success or failure) of the event; and

\item For each audit event type, based on auditable event definitions
of the functional components included in the ST, \emph{the ID of the
corresponding interaction and the identity of the published object.}
\end{itemize}

\end{description}


%___________________________________________________________________________



\minisec{FAU{\_}GEN.2 User identity assocation}
\begin{description}
\item[FAU{\_}GEN.2.1]

The TSF shall be able to associate each auditable event with the identity
of the user that caused the event.


\end{description}


%___________________________________________________________________________



\subsubsection{Class FDP: Data protection}


%___________________________________________________________________________



\minisec{FDP{\_}ACC.2 Complete access control}
\begin{description}
\item[FDP{\_}ACC.2.1 ]

The TSF shall enforce the \emph{Zope access control policy} on \emph{interactions
and objects} and all operations among subjects and objects covered by the SFP.

\item[FDP{\_}ACC.2.2]

The TSF shall ensure that all operations between any
subject in the TSC and any object within the TSC are covered by an
access control SFP.

\end{description}


%___________________________________________________________________________



\minisec{FDP{\_}ACF.1 Security attribute based access control}
\begin{description}
\item[FDP{\_}ACF.1.1]

The TSF shall enforce the \emph{Zope access control policy} to objects based on
\emph{the interaction principal, the permission required for the operation and
the grants of the privilege the required permission is mapped to for that
object or it's ancestor objects}.

\item[FDP{\_}ACF.1.2]

The TSF shall enforce the following rules to determine
if an operation among controlled subjects and controlled objects is
allowed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Access is allowed, if there is no principal associated with the current
interaction. (This is equivalent of running an interaction on system level.)

\item Access is allowed, if the required permission is the special ``public''
permission.

\item Access is allowed if, for each principal associated to the interaction,
there is a privilege grant that is mapped to the required permission for either
the principal or one of the groups the principal is a member of or if the principal is a member
of the administrative system group.

\item If the object does not support sharing, access is determined by checking
the privileges of the next object in the chain of ancestors that supports
sharing.

***Jim
OK, you mention it here.  I wonder if you define ancestor. :)

\item If the object does not support sharing and has no ancestors, then access
is denied.

\item Access is denied in any other case.

\end{itemize}

\item[FDP{\_}ACF.1.3]

The TSF shall explicitly authorise access of subjects to
objects based on the following additional rules: \emph{none}

***Jim
Missing?

\item[FDP{\_}ACF.1.4]

The TSF shall explicitly deny access of subjects to objects
based on the following additional rules: \emph{none}

***Jim
Missing?

\begin{description}

\item[FDP{\_}ROL.2.1 ]

The TSF shall permit \emph{the rollback of all
operations on all objects}.

\item[FDP{\_}ROL.2.2 ]


The TSF shall permit operations to be rolled
back \emph{at any time before the transaction in which the operation was
performed is committed}.
\begin{description}

\item[Note]

This statement may not apply to cached data created
during the course of a transaction.

\end{description}

\end{description}

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsubsection{Class FIA: Identification and authentication}

%___________________________________________________________________________

\minisec{FIA{\_}AFL{\_}z.1 Authentication failure handling}
\begin{description}

\item[FIA{\_}AFL{\_}z.1.1]

The TSF shall detect when there are a configurable number of consecutive
unsuccessful authentication attempts for a single login name,
with no intermediate successful attempts.

\item[FIA{\_}AFL{\_}z.1.2 ]

When the defined number of unsuccessful authentication attempts
has been surpassed, the TSF shall
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Disable authentication against the indicated login name for a
configurable period of time.

\end{itemize}

***Jim
Interesting. :)  I wonder who's gonna implement this.

The TSF shall re-authenticate the user under the conditions
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
If the credentials held by the user agent have expired due to
a configurable time limit.

\item {} 
If the authenticated user does not have the required permissions to
perform a requested operation but the presentation of different
credentials might associate him with a principal that holds enough
permission grants to perform the requested operation.

\section{Security requirements for the IT environment}

The following security requirements exist for the IT environment:

\begin{itemize}

  \item The operating system is Linux. All known security patches must have
      been installed.

  \item The Python Version is 2.4.2 


***Jim
You might double check the schedule for 2.4.3.


  \item The ZODB storage is FileStorage or FileStorage through a ZEO server.

  \item The client software must support ``protected authentication feedback'',
      to at least not echo a user's credentials in plain text (FIA{\_}UAU.7).

  \item The TOE can only be accessed through a ``trusted path'' using secure
      proxies, such as an HTTPS proxy like Apache with SSL, or Pound. Users are
      taught to make correct use of secure channels (e.g. accepting only valid
      SSL certificates). 

  \item If external IT systems are used, a trusted channel between the TOE and
      those systems must be provided by the TOE host environment.  For example,
      while the TOE may communicate with clients on a public network through a
      specific port allowed through a firewall, all communication with other IT
      systems should be over a (virtual) private network.

\end{itemize}
%___________________________________________________________________________

\chapter{TOE summary specification}


\section{TOE security functions}  \label{toe-sec-funcs}


The major functions implemented by the TOE are:


%___________________________________________________________________________


\subsection{Protection}

The protection subsystem is responsible for controlling the access of subjects
to objects.  It does this through the use of security proxies.  Any non-basic
objects that an interaction accesses is wrapped in a security proxy.  All
operations on these non-basic objects are performed through the security
proxies. Security proxies use the authorization system to decide whether access
is allowed.  Any non-basic results of operations performed through security
proxies are security proxied.


***Jim
I hope there is more layer, like definition of basic objects and
mention of special case of attribute access. Maybe even ``untrusted interpreter''.

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection{Authentication}

Within the scope of this certification, Zope provides authentication using HTTP
basic authentication and a cookie-based authentication mechanism. Credentials
can be configured and stored using the configuration system and/or in the ZODB
using the ``Pluggable Authentication Utility''.

***Jim
Note that afaik, we don't have cookie auth per se. We have session auth and 
often use cookies to keep track of sessions.

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection{Authorization / Access control}

To determine whether an operation under a given subject is allowed, Zope has an
authorization subsystem (aka access control). The authorization subsystem uses
pluggable policies to allow the implementation of different rule sets. Zope
provides a default security policy called ``zopepolicy'' and a security policy
considered for this certification called ``sharing policy''.

Policies implement a method 'checkPermission' to determine whether the
requested access is allowed or not. Policies define the information required to
make authorization decisions.  Policies therefore can be implemented to extend
or reduce the current functionality, e.g. for introducing groups.

***Jim
we already have groups

The ``sharing'' policy considers users, groups, permission-to-privilege
mappings, privilege grants, and the context object to make a decision.
Privileges can be granted to principals or groups.  Subjects can consider
multiple principals, for example if the execution of untrusted code is
involved.

If no principal is associated with a subject, the subject is allowed to perform
any operation. However, the publisher component is required to associate a
special anonymous principal if no user has been authenticated.

Every principal is always granted the ``zope.Public'' permission which can't be
denied by any means.

%___________________________________________________________________________


\subsection{Configuration}

The configuration system is used to provide definitions for security
attributes. It is used to define permissions, privileges,
permission-to-privilege mappings, initial principals and other security policy
relevant data.

It can be accessed via the Python API, the Zope management interface and
through ZCML configuration files.

***Jim
ZMI?

The configuration system takes care that any operation made to the security
relevant data does not compromise the systems integrity by disallowing
conflicting declarations.

\subsection{Auditing}

Zope provides an auditing system that listens for events within Zope according
to the SFRs described above. It is implemented using the event framework of
Zope 3 to subscribe to the audit relevant events and log them appropriately.
The infrastructure provided (event listener + logger) satisfies the
requirements as described in FAU{\_}GEN.1 and FAU{\_}GEN.2.

Zope relies on the operating system to deliver reliable time stamps for the
audit log.

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection{Transaction management}

In Zope user data is stored on persistent objects. The transaction machinery
provides ACID compatible transactions (atomic, consistent, isolated, durable)
for any operation on the user data.

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection{Publication / Server}

The publisher allows users to communicate with the Zope server through a
network, using standard protocols and client software like HTTP and web
browsers or FTP and FTP clients. The publisher is the only valid entry point to
communicate with a Zope 3 application as it also is the starting point for the
protection subsystem to be involved.

***Jim
This is true for the ST.  But generally, any ZEO client can access the data. 
In fact, we probably should make statements anout restrictions of other ZEO 
clients for the ST.

The publisher is extensible to allow support for further protocols.

To support FIA{\_}UAU.1 the implementation of a protocol includes the ability to
communicate with a user for requesting authentication data. The ability to
present credentials is specific to the used protocol and clients. By default
HTTP basic auth, cookie authentication and FTP authentication are supported.

***Jim
See remark above wrt cookies

To support FIA{\_}USB.1, the publisher passes the credentials to Zope and calls
the authentication subsystem to validate this data and bind the authenticated
principal to the running interaction.

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection{Automated Tests}

Zope provides a suite of automated tests that allow the user to ensure that the
security functionality in the TOE is consistent with the tests. Those tests are
run in offline mode.  

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection{Python Environment}

As Zope relies on Python and the host environment to provide reliable time
stamps. Changes to the external clock are not audited within the system as we
regard them as beeing out of scope.  Therefore external log mechanisms (syslog
on Unix hosts or the Event log on Windows hosts) should be consulted to detect
those changes. (FPT{\_}STM.1)

\bottomrule
  \caption{Mapping of Threats and Assumptions to Security Objectives}
  \label{tab-SOR}
\end{longtable}

The following list explains why the objectives cover
the threats and assumptions.

\begin{description}
  
  \item[O.IA:] This security objective is necessary to counter the threat
  \textbf{T.IA} because it requires that users must be accurately identified
  and authenticated or incorporate the anonymous principal.

  \item[O.Delegation:] This security objective is necessary to counter the
  threat \textbf{T.Perm} because a user must only be able to delegate the permissions
  he is allowed to delegate. It must not be possible for him to gain any extra
  permissions.
  
  \item[O.Audit:] This security objective is necessary to detect and recover
  from most threats: \textbf{T.IA, T.Perm, T.Operation}
  as those events are logged by the audit log.
  
  \item[O.Protect:] This security objective is necessary to counter the threat
  \textbf{T.AuditFake} because it protects the audit data generation function
  and thereby prevents logging of false information. It also helps to covers
  the assumption \textbf{A.OS} because self-protection mechanisms help to
  dtect security problems in the runtime environment.
  
  \item[O.Access:] This security objective is necessary to counter the threat
  \textbf{T.Operation} because it prevents performing operations on an object
  without having the correct permission. It also counters the threat
  \textbf{T.Host} because functions are objects and thereby protected.

  O.Access also counters the threat \textbf{T.Transaction} because transaction
  managing functions are also objects and therefore protected.

  \item[O.Integrity:] This security objective is necessary to counter the
  threat \textbf{T.RIP} because it prevents that any data will be written if
  an unhandled error occurs.
  
  \item[O.Attributes:] This security objective is necessary to counter the
  threat \textbf{T.RIP} because it
  prevents an attacker form setting inconsistent security attributes from
  which he could gain more access than intended.

  \item[O.ManageRisk:] This security objective is necessary to counter the
  threat \textbf{T.IA} because it makes it less likely that an attacker
  impersonates a principal which allows operations with high negative impact
  since those principals are better protected.

  \item[OE.OS:] This security objective is necessary to both counter the
  threat \textbf{T.Timestamps} and cover the assumption \textbf{A.OS} because
  it asserts that the machine and the operating system the TOE is running on
  are physically secure. This means an attacker cannot access the machine
  directly, i.e. around Zope.

  \item[OE.Auditlog:] This security objective covers the assumption
  \textbf{A.OS}. To keep the operating system secure and detect possible
  intrusions it is vital to continuously monitor the audit log. It is also
  important to keep the Auditlog in a safe place to have enough information to
  recover from an attack.

  \item[OE.Network:] This security objective covers the assumptions
  \textbf{A.Network} because it asserts that all
  network !(!5
  compromising the integrity.

  \item[OE.Client:] This security objective covers the assumption
  \textbf{A.Client} because it makes sure that the identification and
  authentication data is not monitored or interfered.

  \item[OE.Credential:] This security objective covers the assumption
  \textbf{A.Credential} because it demands that the user is keeping the
  credentials to authenticate secret.

\subsection{O.IA --- Identification and authentication}

    A central part of the security machinery within the TOE is the correct
    identification and authentification of users.

    This is covered by the activities:

    \begin{description}
        \item[Asking for and validating a user's credentials:]

            The TOE holds information to uniquely identify a principal and its
            required credentials (FIA\_ATD.1).
            
            The TOE presents the user with a prompt to supply his credentials
            if an operation requires an identified and authenticated principal (FIA\_UAU.1, FIA\_UID.1)

            Depending on the communication channel, the system selects a
            suitable authentication mechanism to ask a user for his
            credentials. (FIA\_UAU.5)

            If an authenticated user does not have enough permission grants to
            perform an operation, he will get the chance to authenticate with
            other credentials. (FIA\_UAU.6)

***Jim
As mentioned above, this is not the default configuration. We should
touch base on this.  BTW, basic auth sucks, Maybe we shouldn't support it. :)



            If the credentials stored at the user agent expire (e.g. cookies in
            a web browser), the user will be asked to represent his credentials
            before performing any further operation. (FIA\_UAU.6)

        \item[Binding users to the correct principals:]

            The TOE allows users to interact with the system without presenting
            credentials by binding unauthenticated users to the ``Anonymous''
            principal. This allows parts of applications to be accessible without
            presenting any credentials. (FIA\_UAU.1)

***Jim
Unauthenticated principal


            Once a user has been identified and authenticated, the subject of
            the operation is bound to the user by selecting the correct
            principal. (FIA\_USB.1)

        \item[Managing required security attributes:]

            The TOE manages the required security attributes (permission grants
            and denials, credentials, \dots). Special permissions are required
            to read or write certain security attributes. (FMT\_MSA.1)

***Jim
The sharing policy doesn't do denials

        \item[Associating principals with the correct security attributes:]

            This is covered by FIA\_ATD.1 and FIA\_USB.1

    \end{description}

\subsection{O.Delegation  --- Securely delegate control}

    Changing permission grants and denials allows the delegation of permission
    grants and denials to other users. Administrators that have grants for all
    permissions introduce new users to the system by delegating the required
    permissions to them (e.g. via roles, direct permission grants or denials).

    Delegating control is a normal operation performed on the TOEs objects. To
    grant a permission special meta permissions are introduced that control the
    ability to delegate a permission. (FMT\_ATD.1)

***Jim
This is out of date.  We don't do denials or roles. :)
The sharing privilege is required to change grants. 


    Those operations are securely managed because they are covered by the TSF
    (FDP\_ACC.2) and follow special rules regarding the management of security
    attributes. (FMT\_MSA.1)

\subsection{O.Audit --- Provide a reliable security audit trail}

    The TOE shall provide functionality to generate audit data (FAU\_GEN.1,
    FAU\_GEN.2).

    The TOE includes reliable time stamps to guarantee reasonable data to be
    logged (FPT\_STM.1) and connects all events with the relevant user
    attributes. (FIA\_ATD.1)

\subsection{O.Protect --- Protect the TOE from external tampering}

    The TOE provides some effort to not allow an insecure situation that
    resulted from tampering with the system. Most situations have to be avoided
    due to correct appliance of the environmental requirements though.

***Jim
I'm nt sure what the above paragraph says. :)
Maybe change ``provides some effort to not allow an insecure situation that
resulted from'' to ``disallows''?


    As the TOE is normally run with access through open communication channels
    like the internet, credentials very likely might be compromised by brute
    force attacks. This is avoided by applying FIA\_AFL\_z.1.

    Changing the behaviour of security functions is a critical operation.
    Therefore a set of well known permissions and roles are established to
    easily identify people that are able to change any security relevant
    behaviour. (FMT\_MOF.1)

***Jim
Roles?
    
    In the case of data loss, failure of subsystems or unexpected situations,
    the usage of FMT\_MSA.3 allows the system to stay in the most secure state
    possible. Asserting restrictive default values for security attributes
    avoids permission elevation and results in a better protected TOE.
    
    Using abstract machine tests, the system is able to check if the security
    code has been modified and does not hold to the assumptions of the security
    machinery anymore. (FPT\_AMT.1)

***Jim
I don't know what an abstract machine test is.

    The TOE holds a special domain for running untrusted code that allows
    external entities not to directly modify or call any security relevant
    attributes or functions. (FPT\_SEP.1)

***Jim
I'm not sure what this is trying to say.  English suggestion: change
``allows external entities not to directly modify or call'' to
``prevents external entities from directly modifying or calling''

\subsection{O.Access --- Mediate every access to objects}

    Mediating every access to an object through operations is another major
    objective to enforce the TSP. (FDP\_ACC.2)

    A set of attributes and rules is used to describe how to apply those
    attributes for deriving an access decision. (FDP\_ACF.1, FIA\_ATD.1)  

    To ensure the non-bypassability of the TSP a special paradigm is used (security
    proxies) for accessing TOE objects from external entities. (FIA\_RVM.1)
    
\subsection{O.Integrity --- Ensure faultless data}

    Providing an ACID compatible transaction management system that allows
    secure rollback from a failed transaction satisfies the objective to have
    the system keep its integrity. (FDP\_ROL.2\_Transactions)

    The rollback is performed by the TOE automatically as soon as an error is
    encountered and not handled by any application logic.

\subsection{O.Attributes --- Ensure consistent security attributes}

    To assure an enduring consistent state of all security attributes we
    enforce the security policy model upon any changes to security attributes.
    (FMT\_MSA.2) Additionally static security attribute initialization assures
    a predictable and secure state if no specific attributes are given.
    (FMT\_MSA.3)

\subsection{O.ManageRisk --- Provide choice of flexibility versus security}

    To manage the risk of using stronger authentication schemes for sensitive
    operations in opposition of weaker authentication schemes for less sensitive
    operations, the TOE allows a selection of the authentication system to
    happen. (FIA\_UAU.5) To increase a users level of access for accessing more
    sensitive operations, a reauthentication may be needed. (FIA\_UAU.6)
    
***Jim
See earlier notes about reauthentication

    The decision what authentication schemes are needed for which operations
    can be managed by authorised administrators. (FMT\_MOF.1)

***Jim
I don't understand this.  Auth schemes don't depend on the operations
being performed.

    Additionally code can be run either within the trusted or untrusted
    security domains of the TOE. Installing code in the trusted security domain
    requires an external entity that has access to the physical secure host to
    install software into the TOE. This allows developers to trade off between
    functionality of their code and the level of trust they have to gain from
    administrators installing their extensions. FPT\_SEP.1 supports the
    distinction between the trusted and untrusted domain.

\subsubsection{Suitability of SF to meet the SFRs}

\minisec{FDP\_ACC.2 --- Complete Access Control}

XXX is there a single point of entry?

***Jim
?

Complete access control is achieved by the \textbf{Protection} subsystem. The
\textbf{Publication} subsystem serves as a single entry point to the Zope 3
application which wraps all published objects into security proxies. The
transient nature of security proxies then covers that all subsequent accesses
are security proxied as well. Thereby all operations among those objects are
covered by the protection subsytem which enforces the Zope access control policy.

\minisec{FDP\_RIP.1 --- Subset residual information protection}

RIP is covered by the \textbf{Configuration} subsystem. This subsystem provides
an API that verifies that the removal of security attributes (like user
accounts) also results in a consistent removal of depending security attributes
(group memberships, role grants, permission grants \ldots).

***Jim
Huh?  How does the configuration system to this?  BTW, there is a
non-trivial amount of development required to get this right.

\minisec{FDP\_ROL.2\_TRANSACTIONS --- Advanced Rollback}

The \textbf{Transaction management} of ZODB allows rollback of transaction. The
\textbf{Protection} and \textbf{Authorization} subsystems (in place by the
complete access control) will deny the unauthorized use of those management
functions. As a result only the subject of a transaction is able to roll back
it's corresponding transaction.

As transactions are only valid within a single subject (operation), there is no
possibility to cancel other transactions through the use of the
\textbf{Publication} subsystem.

\minisec{FIA\_AFL\_z.1 --- Authentication Failure Handling}

AFL is handled in cooperation of the \textbf{Authentication} and
\textbf{Publication} subsystem. The \textbf{Publication} subsystem identifies
individual authentication trials and uses the authentication subsystem to
update the security attributes that store the information about failed
requests. The split of this functionality is needed as the
\textbf{Authentication} subsystem may not be able to distinguish two requests
to be different user initiated requests or started off at another point in the
application.
  

\minisec{FIA\_UAU.1, FIA\_UID.1 --- Timing of authentication and identification}

The \textbf{Publication} subsystem detects provided credentials and existing
sessions on the implemented network protocols. It then either identifies and
authenticates the user for this subject or uses the anonymous principal to
perform the requested operation. If the anonymous principal is not allowed to
perform the requested operation, the \textbf{Publication} subsystem challenges
the user to provide sufficient credentials for authentication and
identification.

\minisec{FIA\_UAU.5 --- Multiple Authentication Systems}

The \textbf{Publication} and \textbf{Authentication} subsystems work together
to identify a meaningful way of asking a user for his credentials. 

The \textbf{Authentication} subsystem can then implement different schemes for
validating the credentials that the \textbf{Publication} system retrieved from
the user.

The choice of retrieval and verification can depend on the network protocol
(FTP, HTTP) and the strength of authentication that is requests (e.g. password,
client certificates).

***Jim
I don't know what ``strength of authentication that is requests'' means.

\minisec{FIA\_UAU.6 --- Re-authentication}

If an operation could not be performed due to missing permission grants, the
\textbf{Publication} subsystem may -- instead of denying further operation --
may ask the user to provide other credentials to authenticate for a different
principal.

***Jim
See my eralier remarks.  Here you say ``may'', which is good because
it is non-commital. :)  Note that you use ``may'' twice.

\emph{Note:} This is implemented by the same scheme that is used to initially
retrieve credentials from a user when the operation could not be performed by
the anonymous principal.

\minisec{FIA\_USB.1 --- User-Subject Binding}

When the \textbf{Publication} system sets up to perform an operation, it
creates a context of ``interaction''. This interaction is always associated
with (at least) one principal. If a principal was authenticated during the
creation of this context, the interaction gets associated with this principal.
Otherwise the anonymous principal will be bound to the subject.

***Jim
anonymous -> unauthenticated


Binding a principal to an interaction transitively associates the required security
attributes (e.g. permission grants) to this interaction.

\minisec{FMT\_MOF.1 --- Management of Security Functions}

Management of security functions happens by different physical ways (editing
configuration files, working with the web interface, writing scripts) that are
all addressing a single security configuration API that is offered by the
\textbf{Configuration}, \textbf{Authentication} and \textbf{Authorization}
subsystems. Access to those subsystems is -- as always -- covered by the
complete access control policy and enforced by the \textbf{Protection}
subsystem.

***Jim
I assume that by ``Configuration'', you mean ZCML.  It is not covered
by the access-control system.

\minisec{FMT\_MSA.1 --- Management of Security Attributes}

The management of security attributes is provided by the \textbf{Configuration}
subsystem. This happens by using the same API as for FMT\_MOF.1 including the
different ways of accessing this API.

***Jim
I'm confused.

\minisec{FMT\_MSA.2 --- Secure Security Attributes}

The \textbf{Configuration} subsystems API for managing security functions and
attributes perform consistency checks upon the change of any security
attributes. This includes for example the check of dependencies that the
removal of principals also has the effect of removal of all dependent
permission grants and denials. 

Also only already existing identifiers (user names, permission names) may only
be used as references if they have been defined previously.

***Jim
ditto

\minisec{FMT\_MSA.3 --- Static Attribute Initialization}

A set of fixed rules that are used whenever an attribute definition is missing
realize the static attribute initialisation. These rules are implemented in the
different subsystems (\textbf{Authorization} and \textbf{Configuration})
whenever a specific attribute would be used or defined.

\minisec{FMT\_SMR.1 --- Security roles}

The \textbf{Authorization} system resolves roles that users hold into
permissions they are granted or denied. The configuration system holds the
definition of what users posess which roles and which roles are granted which
permissions.

Pre-defined permission/role-mappings are delivered with the certified Zope
configuration to match the Administrator, Grantor and User roles.
XXX

***Jim
This appears to be out of date.

\minisec{FPT\_RVM.1 --- Non-bypassability of the TSP}

The concept of the \textbf{Protection} system is to put a layer of protection
around any object that is beeing accessed from an interaction. It is designed
in a transitive manner that it will not allow any computation to bypass it.

\minisec{FPT\_SEP.1 --- TSF domain seperation}

The \textbf{Protection} subsystem allows code that has been brought to the
system via installation on the host filesystem to remove security proxies. This
results in the ability (for performance or functional reasons) to write code
that calls system functions and internal APIs without disturbing the protected
code areas.

When data is passed from the trusted domain into another part of the system,
the Protection system will prevent the elevation of privileges by assuring that
the layer of security proxies is installed and effective.

\subsection{Assurance measures}

The assurance measures are selected in accordance to EAL 1. Additionally due to
the selection of FMT\_MSA.2 the document ADV\_SPM has been selected.

%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection{Choice of TOE security assurance requirements}

The choice of assurance requirements is based on the analysis of the security
objectives for the TOE and on functional requirements defined to meet these
objectives.

The assurance level is \textbf{EAL 1}.

%___________________________________________________________________________


\section{Evaluation assurance level rationale}

The Zope development community recognizes the need of mature and well defined
security functions by its users.

Therefore to meet this requirement the decision for an entry level evaluation
was made on the basis of resource constraints of available developers and
budget.

Additionally an entry level evaluation gives a glance to the community how a
certification may effect Zope's degree of documentation and stabilize the good
security history even more. Eventually this raises interest in Zope 3 for
projects that have strong requirements in respect to security and do seek free
alternatives to closed source projects.

It is intended to show that mature open source projects can outperform
proprietary systems not only on pure functional and monetary aspects but also
in domains that are typically governed by proprietary systems. Performing a
well known standardized evaluation also substantiates confidence and trust that
Zope as a free software project receives by it's users.
