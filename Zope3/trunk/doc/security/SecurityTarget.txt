The main objectives of this Security Target are:

    *   To describe the Target of Evaluation (TOE).

    *   To describe the security environment of the TOE including the assets to
        be protected and the threats to be countered by the TOE and its
        environment.

    *   To describe the security objectives of the TOE and its supporting
        environment.
    
    *   To specify the Security Requirements, which include the TOE security
        functional requirements as of CC, part 2 and the assurance requirements as
        of CC, part 3.
    
    *   To set up the TOE summary specification, which includes the TOE
        security functions specifications and the assurance measures.

ISO/IEC 15408 (CC) Conformance
------------------------------

This ST is claimed to be conformant with the ISO/IEC 15408:1999 (Common
Criteria, Version 2.1 with final interpretations, see [CC]) and its following
parts:

    *   Part 3, EAL1.
    
The assurance level is EAL 1.

TOE description
===============

Overview
--------

For b uilding Web application, framework, ...
Functionality should be provided, main structure

TOE definition
--------------

Product type: Web application server software that provides functionality for
restricting operations on objects based on permissions declared to protect
those operations. 

Principals are granted permissions both statically via configuration files and
dynamically via settings in the object database.  

You can use roles to mediate between principals and permissions. 

Principals are authenticated in various way depending on the means of
connection to a server.  Authentication usually envolves a username-password
such as for FTP-Authentication and HTTP-Basic-Authentication.  Other
authentication mechanisms are possible.

TOE Development and Production
------------------------------

Only authorised persons can modify the Zope source code.

The official / canonical version of Zope is held by Zope Corporation (ZC) in
the ZC the repository.

The certified version is held as a named branch in the ZC repository.

Open source

All changes to source code and other files in the repository are reported
publically to interested persons including those persons that are responsible
for overseeing the quality and direction of parts of Zope.

Any change to a file in the repository causes that file to have a new version
number and the exact change is recorded.

TOE security environment
========================

Assets
------

The following assets have been identified:

    =================   ===========================================
    Asset Name          Description                 
    =================   ===========================================
    Content-Objects
    Operations
    Principals
    Role grants
    Permission grants
    =================   ===========================================

Subjects
--------

Outside of Zope the "system-administrator" configures the Config-files as an
initial step before the first starting of Zope occurs.

Subjects are instantiated principals.

Principals are represented by a unique ID, credentials and metadata.

Credentials are identification and authentication data like username and
password.

Metadata are related information of the principal, just additional information
to the principal.

The ID is the data the system internally identifies the user.

There are two kinds of principals: The anybody-user and the authenticated user.

If a principal has the permission to grant permissions/roles he can grant
permissions/roles to himself and other principals.

Roles are used in applications of Zope to express the different tasks and
responsibilities of users. Permissions are granted to roles and roles are
granted to principals. Therefore roles serve as an indirect means of granting
permissions to principals. Permissions can also be granted directly to
principals. 

Permissions guard operations on objects. A permission has an unique ID.

Operations
----------

Operations are performed on objects. They are defined in an objects class. A
class is defined in the Python programming language and is identified by a
fully qualified name.

A operation is a name defined in a class. It may take a form of an attribute, a
method or some other related python thing.

There are two possible kinds of access to an operation: Reading such as reading
an attribute or calling a method. Writing such as setting or deleting an
attribute. Reading is guarded with a different permission than writing.  

Assumptions (about the environment)
-----------------------------------

The following assumptions need to be made about the TOE environment:

    ===============     ==================================================
    Assumption Name     Description
    ===============     ==================================================
    A.OS                The machine and the operating system Zope is 
                        running on is physical secure.
    A.Admin             The "system-administrator" of the above 
                        mentioned machine is trustworthy.
    A.Network           A network connection to the Zope services is 
                        present. All The other network connection are 
                        secure in such a way that the integrity of 
                        the machine and operating system is preserved.
    A.Client            The connection between client and Zope server is 
                        secure in a sense the the identification and 
                        authentication data is not monitored or interfered.
    A.Credential        The user is keeping the credential to authenticate 
                        secret.
    A.Integrity         The system is administrated such that the system is 
                        free from malicious software like viruses and 
                        Trojan horses.

The following OSP have been identified:

    ========================    ===============================================
    OSP                         Description

                                Corporation, Virginia USA. They must preserve a 
                                cryptographic key in order to change code.
    OSP.Version_numbre          Released versions of Zope cannot be modified. 
                                Any modification would imply a new release

    anonymous principal] on behalf of the user before the [principal] is
    authenticated.

    [Note: It is possible to deny all operations to the anonymous
    principal. This means that a user must login before any actions may
    performed on their behalf. This fullfills the terms of FIA_UAU.2]

    The TSF shall require each [principal] to be successfully
    authenticated before allowing any other TSF-mediated actions on behalf
    of that user.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIA_UAU.6.1 
    The TSF shall re-authenticate the user under the conditions
    [a) that he is trying to perform an action that has been unauthorised and
    is offered the opportunity to present other credentials, if it possible
    that presenting other credentials may result in authorisation. 
    b) If the credentials held by the user agent have expired due to a time 
    limit encoded in those credentials. E.g. a cookie held by a web browser].

FIA_UID.1
~~~~~~~~~

 XXX (copy FIA_UAU.1 here)

FIA_USB.1 User-subject binding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
FIA_USB.1.1
    The TSF shall associate the appropriate user security

    This is currently not sure if it is going to be implemented. Ask someone who knows.
