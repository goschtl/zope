TOE description
===============

Overview
--------

Zope 3 (also referred to as "Zope") is a component based framework that may be
used to build web applications. It's development is historically focused but
not limited on building content management systems.

It is written as platform independent software using the Python programming
language. Therefore it is available for Windows NT, Linux, MacOS X and other
operating systems.

Zope 3 features a set of core components that form an infrastructure for 
building applications by reusing existing components and adding new components
that work together by defined interfaces.

The core functionality contains a web server with WebDAV support, a ftp server
and a XML/RPC server.  It has components that provide functionality for
security management including administration of users, roles and permissions.
Other core components cover an object database, indexing mechanisms,
workflow, a web interface, SQL support an XML-based and a non-XML based templating
mechanism, Python Scripting, I18n and L10n support and many more.

Finally Zope can be extended by the use of packages that
can contain configuration directives, templates, python code
and classes. Those are intended to work together seamlessly using the
ComponentArchitecture to plug them together into more complex systems.

TOE definition
--------------

As a general rule it is possible to describe all activities with and within Zope as
"operations" performed on "objects". The need for security adds a protecting
subject to this by guarding operations with "permissions".

Users of the system are internally identified with "principals" which act on
their behalf.  Those principals are granted permissions (both statically via
configuration files and dynamically via settings in the object database) within
an context to allow them performing operations on a selected set of objects.

Principals are authenticated in various way depending on the means of
connection to a server.  Authentication usually envolves a username-password
pair such as for FTP-Authentication and HTTP-Basic-Authentication.  Other
authentication mechanisms are possible.

  XXX Rewrite this section in terms of the 4-part arch.

TOE Development and Production
------------------------------

The development of Zope 3 is driven by the Zope Corporation together with the
free community of Zope developers. The Zope 3 source code is free to be
retrieved and used by everybody.

The official Zope 3 source code is maintained within a centralized
source-code control system.  Everybody is free to retrieve any
available version of the code anonymously. The certified version is
available on a named branch and identified by a tag.

To ensure a stable production every developer wishing to directly access the
repository must retrieve authorisation from Zope Corporation. This is
expressed by providing a signed contributors agreement,
http://dev.zope.org/DevHome/Subversion/Contributor.pdf.

Write access to the repository is only available through ssh and by providing a
public key to the maintainer of the repository.

All changes to source code and other files in the repository are reported
publically to interested persons including those persons that are responsible
for overseeing the quality and direction of parts of Zope.

Any change to a file in the repository causes that file to have a new version
number and the exact change is recorded. Before writing a change back to the
repository on a branch that is declared for public use or for main development
(release branches, HEAD, main development branches) the developer must
successfully run the prepared unit tests to assure that no code breaks when
applying his changes. Additionally every developer is required to provide unit
test for new code he writes or problems he solves, as far as applicable.

TOE Life Cycle
--------------

The TOE is developed in cycles. New features are introduced in iterative steps
called "feature release" and solutions to known problems are introduced by
steps called "bugfix releases".

The version numbers of the TOE releases express if it is a feature or bugfix
release like this: 3.f.b where f and b are continuous given numbers and f
expresses the f-th feature relase for Zope 3 and b expresses the b-th bugfix
relase for the f-th feature release. Every feature relase starts with bugfix
release 0 in which case the bugfix number may be ommitted. (E.g. 3.1.4,
3.1.0/3.1, 3.0.0/3.0)

Test releases are identified by adding their grade (a for alpha, b for beta, rc
for release candidate) at the end of the version number that it is targeted at.
(3.1.4b2 would be the second beta release for the upcoming version 3.1.4)

New features are proposed and agreed within the developers community by the use
of mailinglists and wiki pages. They are incorportated in an agreed feature
release.

Until agreed to be ready for public test the development and until all features
are available (but maybe untested), development of a feature release happens
on the CVS HEAD branch. When starting public releases, no further features are
allowed to be introduced and the development enters maintanence mode. Therefore
a named branch is created to identify changes that are applied for maintenance.
New features will be introduced on the HEAD branch that is heading for the next
feature release.

Therefore an overall of about 3 concurrent maintained versions can exist:

        * old feature release in maintenance mode
        
        * upcoming feature release, already in maintance mode but not stable
        
        * upcoming feature relaese in free development mode

TOE Boundaries
--------------

Physical Boundaries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Files included in a Zope software distribution.

TOE Logical Boundaries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The logical boundary for the TOE consists of the four security
sub-systems of Zope:

- permission declaration

- protection

- authentication

- authorization

TOE security environment
========================

Assets
------

The following primary assets have been identified:

    =================   ====================================================
    Asset Name          Description
    =================   ====================================================
    (Content) Objects   Generic objects (instances of Python classes) that 
                        are stored and controlled by Zope and carry 
                        information that is to be protected. Objects are 
                        stored in a connected manner that is typically 
                        hierarchical and allows the derivation of 
                        information by the objects context.
    =================   ====================================================

The following secondary assets have been identified:
                        

    =================   ====================================================
    Asset Name          Description
    =================   ====================================================
    Host System         The unit of computer hardware and software that 
                        forms the environment of Zope to run on. (E.g.
                        a PC server with Windows 2000 or Linux installed)

    Operations          Operations are the way of accessing and modifying 
                        data provided by (content) objects.

    Principals          Principals are the systems representation of acting 
                        individuals. A principal acts in behalf of the user 
                        and represents a (content) object of it's own.

    Permission          A permission is a name guarding an operation.

    Permission grants   A permission grant associates a principal with a
                        permission to allow or deny an operation in the context.
                        As a third state, permissions may be declared to
                        be acquired from the context. 

    Audit data          The data generated by the TOE audit subsystem.

    Transaction data    All operations within Zope are held within ACID
                        compatible transactions that are bound to each
                        request from the outside and associated with a 
                        principal.
    =================   ====================================================

Subject
-------

Zope has a concept of interactions, which model the interaction of one
or more users with the system.  An interaction keeps track of the
users that are participating in the interaction as "participations".
In the TOE, interactions will have single users participating through
server request (for example, Web requests).  Interactions are referred
to as "subjects" in the TOE.

Operations
----------

Operations are performed on objects. They are defined in an objects class. A
class is defined in the Python programming language and is identified by a
fully qualified name.

A operation is a name defined in a class. It may take a form of an attribute, a
method or some other related python thing.

There are two possible kinds of access to an operation: Reading such as reading
an attribute or calling a method. Writing such as setting or deleting an
attribute. Reading is guarded with a different permission than writing.  

Assumptions (about the environment)
-----------------------------------

The following assumptions need to be made about the TOE environment:

    ===============     ==================================================
    Assumption Name     Description
    ===============     ==================================================
    A.OS                The machine and the operating system Zope is 
                        running on is physically secure. 
    A.Admin             The "system-administrator" of the above 
                        mentioned machine is trustworthy.
    A.Network           A network connection to the Zope services is 
                        present. All The other network connection are 
                        secure in such a way that the integrity of 
                        the machine and operating system is preserved.
    A.Client            The connection between client and Zope server is 
                        secure in a sense the the identification and 
                        authentication data is not monitored or interfered.
    A.Credential        The user is keeping the credential to authenticate 
                        secret.
    A.Integrity         The system is administrated such that the system is 
                        free from malicious software like viruses and 
                        Trojan horses.
    ===============     ==================================================


Threats
-------

The following threat agents have been identified:

    *   Users having correct authentication credentials who might try to
        acquire more permission grants to get access to operations they
        should not.
        
    *   Users without correct authentication credentials for a certain
        principal trying to authenticate as this.

The following threats against the assets have been identified:

    ==============     ==================================================  =======================================================================
    Threat             Threat description                                  Asset
    ==============     ==================================================  =======================================================================
    T.IA               An attacker might impersonate an authorized         Principal
                       principal without providing the necessary 
                       credentials.
    T.Perm             A principal changes the permission grants           Permission grants,
                       without having the right to do so.                  
    T.Operation        A principal performs an operation on an object      Operation, Object
                       without having the correct permission.
    T.AuditFake        An attacker might convince the audit data           Audit data
                       generation functions to log false information 
                       (date, time, type of event, outcome, user)
    T.Import           An attacker might try to make the system            Secondary assets
                       interpret imported security attributes in a
                       not intended way to acquire a higher level of 
                       access to the system.
    T.RIP              An attacker might try to make the system use        Secondary assets
                       residual information for deciding to allow
                       or deny access to an operation to gain more
                       access than intended.
    T.Transaction      An attacker might try to perform commit or          XXX was given by TUV. not sure if this really applies ...
                       abort operations on foreign transactions to         All assets in ZODB

                       operation to invalid revisions.
    T.USB              An attacker might try to use executable code        XXX does this only apply to TTW code which we dropped anyway?
                       which runs on behalf of another user to perform
                       unauthorized operations and maybe hide his
                       traces.
    T.Timestamps       An attacker might try to hide his actions           Audit data
                       by making the system create false timestamps
                       which would result in wrong association to a
                       user on dynamic IP address ranges.
    T.TrustedPath      An attacker might try to use "user data import"     XXX didn't we drop import/export at all?
                       or "user data export" without being a local 
                       user and using the trusted path.
    T.Host             An attacker might use Python functions that         Host, Object
                       result in direct access to the host environment
                       therefore compromising the host and Zope itself.
    ==============     ==================================================  =======================================================================

Organisational security policies
--------------------------------

OSPs are to be defined by the developer who creates applications using Zope and
the customer running those applications.  Zope as a general purpose application
server does neither require nor impose any OSPs.

Security objectives
===================

Security objectives for the TOE
-------------------------------

The following security objectives have been defined for the TOE:

    ==============  =======================================================================
    Objective Name  Description
    ==============  =======================================================================
    O.IA            All principals must be accurately identified and
                    authenticated with the exception of the "unauthenticated"
                    principal.

    O.Delegation    Provide the ability to securely delegate control. Users can
                    delegate the ability to control access to selected
                    operations to others. To delegate a permission, a meta permission
                    that allows you to delegate this permission must be granted.

    O.Audit         The TOE will provide the means of recording any 
                    security relevant events, so as to assist an 
                    administrator in the detection of potential attacks 
                    or misconfiguration of the TOE security features 
                    that would leave the TOE susceptible to attack, and 
                    also to hold users accountable for any actions 
                    they perform that are relevant to security.

    O.Protect       The TOE will protect itself against external
                    interference or tampering by untrusted subjects or
                    attempts by untrusted subjects to bypass the TOE
                    security functions. See Guide B.4

    O.Access        The TOE ensures that access to objects is
                    mediated by operations and guarded by permissions.

    O.Integrity     Whenever an unhandled error within the context of a
                    running transaction occurs (related or unrelated
                    to security) the transaction will be rolled back
                    and the system will be in the state before the
                    transaction started.

    O.Attributes    Whenever attributes are set using identifiers
                    (e.g. principal, or permission identifiers), the
                    identifiers must be defined.
 
    O.ManageRisk    Provide the ability to manage risk by trading off
                    functionality against risk. For example, we can
                    make it easier to access the system to perform 
                    operations whose potential negative impact is
                    low, but make it more difficult to access the
                    system in a way that allows operations with high
                    negative impact.
    ==============  =======================================================================

Security objectives for the environment
---------------------------------------

The following security objectives have been defined for the TOE environment:


    ===============     =======================================================
    Assumption Name     Description
    ===============     =======================================================
    OE.OS               The machine and the operating system Zope is running 
                        on is physically secure.
    OE.Trust            Those responsible for the TOE must be trustworthy.
    OE.Manage           Those responsible for the TOE must ensure that the TOE 
                        is delivered, installed, managed, and operated in a 
                        manner which maintains IT security.
    OE.AUDITLOG         Administrators of the TOE must ensure that audit 
                        facilities are used and managed effectively. In 
                        particular: 
                        
                        a) Appropriate action must be taken to ensure continued 
                           audit logging, e.g. by regular archiving of logs 
                           before audit trail exhaustion to ensure sufficient 
                           free space. 
                        b) Audit logs should be inspected on a regular basis, 
                           and appropriate action should be taken on the 
                           detection of breaches of security, or events that 
                           are likely to lead to a breach in the future.

    OE.Network          A network connection to the Zope services is present. 
                        All other network connections are secure in such a 
                        way that the integrity of the machine and operating 
                        system is preserved.
    OE.Client           The connection between client and Zope server is secure 
                        in a sense that the identification and authentication 
                        data is not monitored or interfered.
    OE.Credential       The user is keeping the credential to authenticate 
                        secret.

Security requirements
=====================

TOE security requirements
-------------------------

TOE security functional requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following functional requirements identify the TOE functional requirements.
They have been drawn from the CC Part 2 functional requirements components.

Class FAU: Audit data generation
********************************

FAU_GEN.1 Audit data generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FAU_GEN.1.1
    The TSF shall be able to generate an audit record of the following auditable
    events:

    a)  Start-up and shutdown of audit functions;

    b)  All auditable events for the *[minimum]* level of audit; and

    c)  *[select: other events XXX]* 

FAU_GEN.1.2

    The TSF shall record within each audit record at least the
    following information:

    a) Date and time of the event, type of event, subject identity,
        and the outcome (success or failure) of the event; and

    b) For each audit event type, based on auditable event definitions
        of the the the functional components included in the ST,
        *[assignment: the ID of the corresponding interaction, other audit relevant information XXX]*
    
FAU_GEN.2 User identity assocation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FAU_GEN.2.1

    The TSF shall enforce the *[formal security policy]* on
    *[subjects: interactions and objects: content objects]* and all
    operations among subjects and objects covered by the SFP.

    XXX
       We now protect adapters of various kinds. This implies that
       adapters are assets, but we think that they should not be.

FDP_ACC.2.2
    The TSF shall ensure that all operations between any
    subject in the TSC and any object within the TSC are covered by an
    access control SFP.

FDP_ACF.1 Security attribute based access control

      object.

    - Access is allowed if access would be allowed and would not be
      denied for the subject's principal for the required permission

    ==============  ======================================  ===================

Security requirements for the IT environment
--------------------------------------------


ITITIT

The following security requirements exist for the IT environment:

The operating system is Windows 2000, Windows XP or Linux. Either all
known security patches must have been installed.

The Python Version is 2.3.2 or a compatible Bugfix release.

The ZODB storage is FSStorage or XXX ... What else?.

The client software must support "protected authentication feedback"
(FIA_UAU.7), to at least not echo a user's credentials in plain text.

One or more "trusted paths" to the TOE must be provided using secure
proxies, such as an HTTPS proxy like Apache with SSL, or Pound.

If external IT systems are used, a trusted channel between the TOE and
those systems must be provided by the TOE host environment.  For
example, while the TOE may communicate with clients on a public
network through a specific port allowed through a firewall, all
communication with other IT systems could be over a private network.

To ensure a "trusted path" to the TOE, users of the TOE must use
secure proxies correctly (for example, being sure to accept only
valid server certificates with HTTPS).

Security requirements for the non-IT environment
------------------------------------------------

XXX I can't find any right here, maybe I should check cross-references, but it
also looks like non-IT requirements are not mandatory.

TOE summary specification
=========================

TOE security functions
----------------------

The major functions implemented by the TOE are:

Protection
----------

The protection subsystem is responsible for controlling the access of subjects
to objects.  It does this through the use of security proxies.  Any non-basic
objects that an interaction accesses is wrapped in a security proxy.  All
operations on these non-basic objects are performed through the security
proxies. Security proxies use the authorization system to decide whether access
is allowed.  Any non-basic results of operations performed through security
proxies are security proxied.

Authentication
--------------

Zope provides a flexible authentication schema that by default supports HTTP
Basic Auth and is extensible to support different data
storages. Zope defines interfaces to implement different mechanisms for
authentication data schemas as well as authentication mechanisms. By default
Zope provides components to store username/password pairs in the ZODB and to
authenticate with a username/password pair through HTTP Basic Authentication
and FTP authentication.


Authorization / Access Control
------------------------------

To determine whether an operation under a given subject is allowed, Zope has an
authorization subsystem (aka access control). The authorization subsystem uses
pluggable policies to allow the implementation of different rule sets. Zope
provides a default security policy called 'zopepolicy'. 

Policies implement a method 'checkPermission' to determine whether the
requested access is allowed or not. Policies define the information required to
make authorization decisions.  Policies therefore can be implemented to extend
or reduce the current functionality, e.g. for introducing groups.

The default policy considers roles, grants and denials, location and principals
to drive the decision. Permissions can be granted or denied to principals
directly or by roles.  Subjects can consider multiple principals if the
execution of untrusted code is involved. 

If no principal is associated with a subject, the subject is allowed to perform
any operation. The publisher component is required to bind an anonymous
principal with the special role "zope.Anonymous" if no user has been
authenticated.

Every principal is automatically granted the "zope.Anonymous" role which can't be
denied by any means. Also, every principal is granted the "zope.Public"
permission which can't be denied by any means.

The 'zopepolicy' favors more specific declarations (permissions granted to
principals over permissions granted to roles or grants that are nearer in terms
of location) in contrast to more general (e.g. global declarations). Therefore
it is possible to make exceptions for individuals from permissions granted to a
role.

Auditing
--------

Zope provides an auditing system that listens for events within Zope according
to the SFRs described above. It is implemented using the event framework of
Zope 3 to subscribe to the audit relevant events and log them appropriately.
The infrastructure provided (event listener + logger) satisfies the
requirements as described in FAU_GEN.1 and FAU_GEN.2.

Zope relies on the operating system to deliver reliable time stamps for the
audit log.
                
Transaction management
----------------------

Most data is stored on persistent objects. The transaction machinery rolls back
all data that is stored on persistent objects. 

Undo 
----

- storage support

- can redo

- any level

- can undo a transaction, if there aren't any un-undone transactions that touch
  the same objects, if a conflict arises while changing the objects during
  undo, application level conflict resolution is used to try to resolve a
  conflict. if a conflict can't be resolved the undo can't be done.

Undo only allows the rollback of serial N last transaction to avoid integrity issues.

Publication / Server
--------------------

XXX get servers, protocols and publisher right

The publisher allows users to communicate with the Zope server through a
network, using standard protocols and client software like HTTP and browsers or
FTP and FTP clients.

The publisher is extensible to allow support for further protocols.

To support FIA_UAU.1 the implementation of a protocol includes the ability to
communicate with a user for requesting authentication data. The ability to
present credentials is specific to the used protocol and clients. By default
HTTP Basic Auth and FTP authentication are supported. 

To support FIA_USB.1, the publisher also returns the credentials to Zope and
calls the authentication subsystem to validate this data and binds the
authenticated principal to the running interaction.

Automated Tests
---------------

Zope provides a suite of automated tests that allow the user to ensure that the
security functionality implemented with a delivered package is consistent with
the tests. Those tests can be run in offline mode.

Python Environment XXX
----------------------

As Zope relies on Python and the host environment to provide reliable time
stamps, we regard auditing adjustments to the time being out of scope.
Therefore external log mechanisms (Syslog on Unix hosts or the Event log on
Windows hosts) should be consulted to detect those changes. (FPT_STM.1)

Choice of security functional requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

XXX

Justification for suitability of SFR - TOE security objectives
--------------------------------------------------------------

Choice of TOE security assurance requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The choice of assurance requirements is based on the analysis of the security
objectives for the TOE and on functional requirements defined to meet these
objectives.  

The assurance level is **EAL 1**.

Evaluation Assurance Level rationale:
-------------------------------------

XXX review this paragraph please.

The Zope development community recognizes the need of mature and well defined
security functions by its users.

Therefore to meet this requirement the decision for an entry level evaluation
was made on the basis of resource constraints of available developers and
budget. 

Additionally an entry level evaluation gives a glance to the community how
certification may effect Zope's degree of documentation and stabilize the good
security history even more, maybe raising the interest for projects that
require good security behaviour and seek free alternatives. 

XXX mention "confidence"

It is intended to show that mature open source projects can outperform
proprietary systems not only on pure functional and monetary aspects but also
in domains that are typically governed by proprietary systems.

General
-------

    *   Bibliographic references

    *   Numbering of sections would be fine

    *   Consolidate the use of the term "anonymous user", "anonymous principal"

    *   Consolidate the use of the term "permission grant" and "permissions"

    *   Rationale


Nice to have / Future
=====================

  * FPT_TST is mostly handled by unit tests. What we don't handle is
    data integrity.  This might be something to consider for future
    evaluations. 

  * FTA_TAH.1 TOE access history

  * FIA_SOS.1 Specification of "identification" functions.

Notes
=====

- XXX we might want to think about realigning our terminology
  (Access/protection/authorization)

- The TOE will not have TTW created (untrusted) and stored code.
  So, no TTW templates. 

- There should be some advice somewhere of the importance of having
  universal (as opposed to system) principal and permission
  identifiers if "export of user data with security attributes" is
  supported.  We might want to think about using guids in auth
  services.

- There must be no operations inder the control of the TSF that cause
  data to be modified non-transactionally.  An exception to this rule
  is that cache data are not transactional.

- It would be useful, when time allows (hehe) to abstract the security
  policy into a profile and then see if other security profiles could
  be "substituted".

- We will need to define events that the auditing system can subscribe
  to to do what it wants.  Ideally, these events should not be defined
  by the auditing system, so as not to create dependencies of other
  systems on the logging system.


Questions to Zope 3 Dev
=======================

FAU_GEN.1.2
    Other audit data to store?        

What about the "nice to have" functions?

    FIA_SOS.1   :   password effectiveness check
    FIA_AFL.1   :   authentication failure counter
    
Should we refer to some "hard coded" permissions that will be required to perform
certain tasks? (e.g. for adding/deleting principals, granting permissions ...)
This will make the evaluation more specific and/but easier.

* Please look through the security functions (chapter TOE summary specification)
  and check if there is wrong terminology. Also we probably will have to implement
  some of the stuff i'm claiming there. :)

* Jim talked about something that is described in FMT_SMR.3:
  "Assuming roles requires that an explicit request is given to the TSF to assume a Role".
  Are we going to have that?

* In TSF_AUD (summary specification): I'm guessing about the function of the security audit
  logger (doesn't sound too hard, maybe I should/could write that thing)


- Talk about caching of security data

Stuff I don't want to throw away
================================

Definitions
-----------

Principal
        An object, managed by an Authentication service that
        represents a user of the system.  Principal have 
        system-unique identifiers that aree used by other systems to maintain
        information about them.

Permission
        An object, managed by the Zope application that represents the
        ability to perform one or more operations.
