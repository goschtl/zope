<h3>Z Object Publishing Environment</h3>

<p>The Z Object Publishing Environment, aka Zope, is a production of <a href="http://www.digicool.com/">Digital Creations</a>.
Many individuals have contributed code and ideas to this project. We
would not be where we are today with such strong community support. 
Jeff Bauer in particular deserves recognition as the leader of the PCGI
project.</p>
<p>Thanks also to Guido van Rossum and the Python community for the 
wonderful <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python language</a>.</p>
