    Zope 2.2.0 beta 1
    
      Features Changed

        - Split the old CHANGES.txt into two files. CHANGES.txt will 
          now contain only change information for the current Zope 
          release. Change information for older versions is now in 
          the file HISTORY.txt.

      Bugs Fixed

        - Added type checking to the constructor and edit methods of
          builtin Zope object types to prevent inappropriate passing
          of acquisition-wrapped objects for standard attributes (like 
          title, etc.). A similar restriction was added to prevent the
          adding of wrapped objects as properties.

        - Fixed a naming bug in MailHost that caused simple_send to
          fail.

        - Fixed a buglet in the rename form that caused the form to submit
          to the old manage_renameObject if the user just hit the enter 
          key in the browser on a single item rename.

        - A bug that caused the tabs to disappear after performing cache
          management operations was fixed.

        - A problem that prevented multiple Zope instances from running 
          at the same time on win32 was fixed.

        - An algorithm in medusa's max_sockets.py code was updated to 
          improve startup time on certain platforms.

        - The behavior of manage_editProperties on PropertyManagers and
          PropertySheets has been fixed so that existing properties that
          are not found in the update request are not reset to empty 
          values.
