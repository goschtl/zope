  Zope X3.0.0 Milestone 3

    What is Zope X3? It's Zope 3 "experimental". This is the release
    that will provide the new features of Zope 3 without any Zope 2
    support.   Zope 3.0 will provide support for Zope 2 content and
    products, probably using conversion utilities of some sort. 

    - Configuration of the application server using a ZConfig-syntax
      configuration file with a simple schema.  This replaces
      zserver.zcml.

    - New schema field types for vocabularies.  See
      schema/vocabularies.txt for detailed documentation.

    - Added low-level support in TALES for path expressions of the form 
      'a/b:c', which work by finding an adapter named 'b' for the
      object named by 'a' and traversing the adapter with the name
      'c'.

      Also defined and registered an adapter named 'zope', that
      provides a number of handy functions. For example, to gewt an
      object's name, use::

         someobject/zope:name

      Many more utility functions will be added over time.

      We still need a way to define other adapters. The mechanism for
      doing so is still undecided.

   - Added zope.app.zapi module that collects common application
     functions and other objects. This is to simplify imports for
     application code.  To get at many common objects, you can simply
     import zapi and then access the functions through zapi::

        from zope.app import zapi

        ...

        adapter = zapi.getAdapter(x, IFoo)

   - Added a pluggable authentication service.  The service supports
     pluggable principal sources and authentication methods (through
     views on principal sources). 

     Deprecated the simple auth service.

   - Initial implementation of file-system synchronization.  This
     allows:

     * Checking out objects from Zope to files in a local directory

     * Checking in Zope objects, with conflict resolution

     * Exporting objects

     * Importing objects

     (We need docs for this.)

   - Very preliminary local interface service

     The interface service will someday provide a tool for browsing 
     and modifying all of the configurtions for a interface (type).

     The inistal version demostrates browsing component configurations
     be showing you all views configured for an interface.

   - WebDAV:

     Added PROPFIND and MKCOL to DAV support. Also added
     IDAVSchemaService, to allow registering an adapter to be used for
     a given namespace on PROPFIND requests.

  Zope X3.0.0 Milestone 2

    What is Zope X3? It's Zope 3 "experimental". This is the release
    that will provide the new features of Zope 3 without any Zope 2
    support.   Zope 3.0 will provide support for Zope 2 content and
    products, probably using conversion utilities of some sort. 
    This release is the second Zope 3 release. The goals of
    this release are to:

    - Provide a relatively firm foundation for Zope 3
      developers who want to start building Zope 3 products or to
      contribute to development.  

    - Provide wider exposure of Zope 3.

    - Solicit input on features, current and missing.

    The first release was very slow.  This release is much less
    slow, but it's not fast.  We have mostly avoided
    optimization to keep the code as clean as possible. Optimization
    will be performed prior to the first beta release.

    This is STILL an EARLY release. There is very little organized
    documentation, although there are some tutorials
    (http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/ProgrammerTutorial) and lots of bits of
    documentation spread around the system.

    A lot of work has been done since the last release, including:

    - General UI improvements

    - Performance improvements (much more to come)

      This release is much less slow than the previous release.

    - Improvements to the through-the-web site management experience
      (There's still a lot more to do.)

    - Internationalization improvements

    - FTP Support

    - PUT support (Allowing editing with Mozolla/Netscape Composer and 
                   Amaya).

    - Partial WebDAV support
          
    - A basic workflow system

    - Improvements to Zope 3 schemas and form generation

    - A functional testing framework

    - Virtual Hosting support

    - A Utility service

    - XML "interfaces" derived from XML Schema URIs.
      These marker interfaces can be used to control application
      of XML processing using the component architecture.

    - New search indexes

    - Views on exceptions.

  Zope X3.0.0 Milestone 1 (formerly known as 3x.0.0 Alpha 1)

    This release was the first Zope 3 release. The goals of
    this release are to:

    - Provide a relatively firm foundation for Zope 3
      developers who want to start building Zope 3 products or to
      contribute to development.  

    - Provide wider exposure of Zope 3.

    - Solicit input on features, current and missing.

    The alpha release *was* very slow. We have intentionally avoided
    optimization to keep the code as clean as possible. Optimization
    will be performed prior to the first beta release.

    Features

      - An initial management interface including folders and various
        content types such as files, images, DTML pages, ZPT pages,
        and SQL scripts.

        The initial user interface is a prototype. We welcome
        feedback, ideas, and even code!

      - A framework for configuring and installing file-system-based
        products. 

      - An initial through-the-web configuration and development system based
        on services. Services are similar to CMF tools except that
        they are managed in service managers, rather than in folders.

        A number of predefined services will be included:

        - Simple authentication service (similar to Zope 2's
          original user folder).

        - Event service.

        - RDB Connection service. This is used to manage database
          connection objects used by SQL scripts.

        - Translation service, to manage software (as opposed to
          content) translation services.

        - Caching service.

        - Site error reporting service (like Zope 2's site error log)

        - Session service (uh, that nobody has tried to use yet :)

        - Role service

        - Adapter service

        - View services

        - Object Hub, which tracks object locations, allowing
          location-independent object references

        - A principal annotation (user data) service. Nobody has tried
          to use this yet. It passes it's tests.

        Through the web development will take place in packages, which
        can contain:

        - Persistent python modules (These might work now. Give em a
          try. :)

        - Templates

        - Component instances 

        - Configuration objects

        Configuration objects are used to configure component
        instances and component factories and register with the
        appropriate services.

      - FTP support (not sure if this works)

      - XML-RPC support  (not sure if this works)
