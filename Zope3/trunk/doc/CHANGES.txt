    Zope 2.2.0 beta 1
    
      Features Changed

        - Split the old CHANGES.txt into two files. CHANGES.txt will 
          now contain only change information for the current Zope 
          release. Change information for older versions is now in 
          the file HISTORY.txt.

      Bugs Fixed

        - Added type checking to the constructor and edit methods of
          builtin Zope object types to prevent passing inappropriate
          objects for standard attributes (like title, etc.).

        - Fixed a naming bug in MailHost that caused simple_send to
          fail.
