    Zope 2.2.0 beta 1
    
      Features Changed

        - Split the old CHANGES.txt into two files. CHANGES.txt will 
          now contain only change information for the current Zope 
          release. Change information for older versions is now in 
          the file HISTORY.txt.

        - Added support for mountable databases. A separate product
          will still be required to make use of this ability.

      Bugs Fixed

        - Added type checking to the constructor and edit methods of
          builtin Zope object types to prevent inappropriate passing
          of acquisition-wrapped objects for standard attributes (like 
          title, etc.). A similar restriction was added to prevent the
          adding of wrapped objects as properties.

        - Fixed a naming bug in MailHost that caused simple_send to
          fail.

        - Fixed a buglet in the rename form that caused the form to submit
          to the old manage_renameObject if the user just hit the enter 
          key in the browser on a single item rename.

        - A bug that caused the tabs to disappear after performing cache
          management operations was fixed.

        - A problem that prevented multiple Zope instances from running 
          at the same time on win32 was fixed.

        - An algorithm in medusa's max_sockets.py code was updated to 
          improve startup time on certain platforms.

        - The behavior of manage_editProperties on PropertyManagers and
          PropertySheets has been fixed so that existing properties that
          are not found in the update request are not reset to empty 
          values.

        - A problem that disallowed access to the individual records in 
          a result set from a SQL method was fixed.

        - A problem that caused the query template for an SQL method to
          be rendered twice when used from the "test" tab has been fixed.

        - Corrected DateTime.py to recognize years specified as 00 through
          69 as 2000 through 2069.
