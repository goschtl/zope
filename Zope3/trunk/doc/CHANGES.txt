Zope Changes

  This file gives information on changes made to Zope over time,
  things that need to be done before the next release and future
  plans.

  Releases

    Zope 1.11.0 pr1
      
      Lots has changed in this release. The major news is ZClasses and WebDAV.
      
      TO DO !!!!!!

        - Fix binary distributions so they aren't so darn big:

           - Remove config and other unneeded subdirs of the
             inluded python libraries.

           - Don't include pycs and pyos in dist.

           - Compile pycs and pys as part of the desitination
             install.

      Features Added

        - Added WebDAV support. See http://webdav.zope.org/ for details.

        - Added Z Classes. Documentation is forthcoming.

          ZClasses might be viewed as somewhat experimental, although
          we're using them aggressively for internal projects.

        - Added Property Sheets. Documentation is forthcoming.
        
        - ZServer now included in distribution.
        
        - Added new product registration interface. Documentation is
          forthcoming.

        - Added local roles which allow for permission settings for
          users on individual objects. This allows for 'ownership' of Zope
          objects. Added 'Owner' role to default roles, and automatic
          setting of the 'Owner' role on a created object to the user who
          created it.
        
        - Added hooks for XML-RPC support to ZPublisher. See the source
          for details. XML-RPC support is not yet finished.
        
        - Added automatic height/width detection for JPEG images.

        - Revised Zope error messages.

        - A new DTML try 'tag' added based on work by Jordan B. Baker.

        - A new 'range' function added the the '_' DTML variable. 

        - A new 'utilities' directory is included in the distribution.

        - A new flag attribute, 'only', of the DTML 'with' tag
          prunes the DTML namespace to only the namespace created
          with the with tag.

        - Added contributed support for encoding options in the SendMail
          tag and MailHost send method.
          
        - Mangement tabs are now prettier and allow status messages with
          the manage_tabs_message variable.
          
        - Added a method of notifying users of changes without using a
          MessageDialog. This makes editing DTML Documents and Methods
          easier.
          
        - Added more documentation to Product add screens.

        - New icons for many Zope objects.

        - Sessions are now known as Versions.

        - Changed from using 'manage_main' as default management method to use
          'manage_workspace' which is a reserved method that dispatches to the
          default management interface which is the first interface defined
          in manage_options

        - Permission settings are now inherited by Products from their base
          classes. This means when you build a Product you only need to specify
          its particular permission settings.

        - Changed ZPublisher.publish_module's interface so that instead of
          providing a stdin, stdout, and stderr, you can provide a Request and
          a Response object. ZServer makes extensive use of this feature.

        - Added methods to HTTPRequest to allow access to ZPublishers object
          traversal. HTTPRequest.clone and HTTPRequest.resolve_url. See the
          source for more details.
          
        - Added a new "builtin" function reorder to DTML.
        
          reorder(s, [with, without]])
 
          Reorder the items in s according to the order given in with
          and with items mentioned in without removed.  Items from s
          not mentioned in with are removed.

          s, with, and without are all either sequences if strings
          or sequences of key-value tuples, with ordering done on the
          keys.

          This function is useful for constructing ordered select lists.

      Bugs Fixed

        - Added small fixes to ZopeHTTPServer in anticipation of DAV.

        - Construction, upload, and edit methods did not consistently
          support either string or file data.  This caused really weird
          behavior when file upload was used with out includeing the 
          ":string" suffix in the argument name when doing a file upload.

          This bug was previously (and incorrectly) reported as a 
          ZPublisher.Client problem.

        - Errors in ExternalMethods were masked by bugs in error
          reporting logic.  The bugs were made far more effective
          by Python 1.5.1.

        - Databases (or export files) created in binary distributions
          were not usable in source distributions due to cPickle
          limitations in stock Python 1.5.1.  We now link/copy the
          cPickle extension to BoboPOS to make sure that it uses the
          latest version.

        - Fixed registration of MailHost settings and incorrect default
          quoted-printable encoding of message bodies.

        - Added contributed patch that fixes bug in copied-object id
          generation.

        - DTML Documents and Methods now attempt to determine their
          content-type rather than assuming they are text/html.

        - Fixed PUT bug in determining content-type of binary files.

        - Added changes that allow the top level userfolder to be replaced by a
          UserDB or other userfolder-like object.

        - Fixed an FTP support bug that sometimes kept simple items from
          producting FTP listings.

        - Added URL1 instead of "." as the form target for the workspace forms --
          using "." causes NS servers to intercept the request and report an
          error, making Zope effectively unusable.

        - Added ZPL 1.0 and credits to copyright link in management screen.
          
        - Fixed a bug that prevented validate() from working if the top-level
          object were accessed and no default object (index_html) existed.

	- Fixed a logic bug in security validation that allowed access to
          unacquired objects that didn't have __roles__ even if the
          containing object was protected.

    Zope  1.10.2

      Bugs Fixed

        - Fixed a permission problem with DTMLMethod objects that caused
          errors when attempting to commit permission changes.

        - Factories could not determine the available methods
          when they were being edited, making them uneditable.

    Zope  1.10.1

      This is a Python 1.5.2 beta 2 compatability release.

      A Python C API change in Python 1.5.2 beta 2 broke
      Zope.  This release contains a fix.

      Zope should work correctly with Python 1.5, 1.5.1 and
      beta versions of 1.5.2.

    Zope  1.10.0

      New Features

        - Added Import/Export interfaces to Folders.

      Bugs Fixed

        - Fixed a bug in ZopeHTTPServer which caused it to fail on POST
          requests without content-type headers.

        - PUT and file uploads would fail if the content-type could
          not be determined. Now objects created via PUT and file
          upload will default to either 'application/octet-stream'
          for binary files or 'text/plain' for non-binary files if
          no content-type can be determined from headers or filename
          extensions.

        - Fixed a permission bug left from a change to the Find support.

        - Fixed misc typos in docstrings and docs.

        - Fixed a bug that kept objects from being freed from the cache!
          Basically, there was never a check for inactive objects.

        - MailHost objects didn't do appropriate CRLF conversion or
          recognize 4xx server responses.

    Zope  1.10.0 pr1

      New Features

        - Documents generated by the search interface wizard
          no longer use tab characters.

        - Added a -s option to ZopeHTTPServer.  This is useful
          for emulating older sites when generating screen shots
          for creating or updating documentation.

        - Default bobobase now includes a Zope button along with a link
          to the Zope site. This satisfies the ZPL attribution requirement.
          The button is created by a new builtin method
          'ZopeAttributionButton'. Also, both the source and the binary
          distributions now have the same default bobobase.

        - Made the logic for getting SOFTWARE_HOME a bit more robust, so that 
          it handles relative paths and paths starting with '.' and '..'.
          This is useful when simply importing Main from the Python
          prompt in the lib/python directory.

        - The ThreadLock module has been changed to reflect changes
          in the Python API in Python 1.5.2.

        - The '_' variable in DTML now has the random module
          as an attribute and DateTime.DateTime as the attribute DateTime.

        - Added keys() and items() methods to the REQUEST object.

        - Added get_header() method to the REQUEST object for retrieving
          HTTP headers.

        - New SearchIndex package and BTree component have been added to 
          the distribution, providing low-level support for products with
          built-in searching such as Tabula and Confera.

        - Documents have now been split into two distinct object types:
          DTML Documents and DTML Methods. DTML Methods behave exactly
          as Document objects did. DTML Documents are similar except that
          the "client" or "self" of a DTML Document is the DTML Document
          itself rather than its parent, and DTML Documents can have
          properties.

        - DTML Documents, Image and File objects can now have properties.

        - A new PropertyManager mixin class allows developers to easily
          add properties and property management to non-Folder objects.

        - Added a new absolute_url method which can generate an absolute
          url for the object on which the method is called.

        - GIF and PNG Images now figure out their own dimensions when
          uploaded. Image height and width properties are now editable.

        - Images now generate themselves as html IMG tags, using an absolute
          url and correct height and width tags if possible.

        - There is a new form input type, boolean, for inputing boolean
          data.

        - Added a read_only option to the SimpleDB.MultipleRevision and 
          PickleDictionary constructors to open a database in read_only
          mode.

        - Added an environment variable, ZOPE_READ_ONLY, used by the
          Zope framework.  If this variable is set, then the database
          is opened in read only mode.  If this variable is set to a
          string parsable by DateTime.DateTime, then the database is
          opened read-only as of the time given.  Note that changes
          made by another process after the database has been opened
          are not visible.

        - Added a database_quota option to the SimpleDB.MultipleRevision and 
          PickleDictionary constructors and a
          SimpleDB.MultipleRevision.set_quota method to set a database
          quota. The quota is given as either an integer number of
          bytes, or a function taking an integer number of bytes
          argument and returning whether the quota has been exceeded.

        - Added an environment variable, ZOPE_DATABASE_QUOTA, used by the
          Zope framework. If this variable is set, it should be set to
          an integer number of bytes.  Additions to the database are
          not allowed if the database size exceeds the quota.          

        - Added size and last modification time to DTML Method and DTML
          Document edit interface.

        - Added a new module, BoboPOS.winlock, that provides file
          locking on windows.  This should prevent many cases of data
          corruption. 

        - Added FTP support to Documents, Files, Images, and Folders.
          FTP interface is detailed in OFS/FTPInterface.py though it may
          change. Basic FTP support was also added to SimpleItem to make
          it easier for Zope objects to support FTP.

      Bugs Fixed
 
        - Permissions for manage_clone method were wrong, meaning that
          essentially only managers could use it.

        - File paths that showed up in tracebacks reflected the paths the 
          files had when they were compiled (at distribution build-time).
          The compiled-in paths have been changed to be relative to the
          Zope installation directory.

        - Fixed a bug in ZPublisher's special handling the "cancel"
          submit buttons. The test for the cancel button was case
          sensitive.  I changed it so it would accept any case, as
          well as extra spaces.

          Cancel buttons should probably be handled using the new
          :method form type, but this would require the presense of an
          appropriate redirect method.  Perhaps there should be
          a :redirect form type.

        - Date strings with years < 31 were not accepted, even
          through the documentation says they should be.

        - If Zope crashed or was unable to completely write a database
          record, then on restart, a data corruption error was reported.
          Now, truncated records are removed if necessary on start up.
          If necessary, other records are removed as well to avoid 
          partially-written transactions.

        - Lack of sys.argv in the win32 service version of Zope caused 
          it to raise errors under certain conditions.

        - Several HTTP PUT related bugs were fixed.

        - Simple items did not have an objectValues method, which caused
          odd behavior in certain tree tags since the method would be
          acquired from the parent of the simple item.

        - The Find form in the management interface depended on javascript
          to function properly.

        - Added a fix to compensate for the fact that Apache servers may 
          rename the entire cgi environment when mod_rewrite rules are 
          used in .htaccess files.

        - If system clocks were changed, so that database records 
          had records in the "future", then database corruption could
          either occur or be incorrectly reported.  Now this situation
          results in an informative error message and corruption does
          not occur.

    Zope 1.9.0

      New Features

        - Zope now provides better information about products.  If a 
          Product has a README.txt, then it will be readable through
          the product management interface.   

          If a product encounters an error during startup, the
          traceback is available through the product management
          interface.

        - Cache statistics are displayed in minutes, rather than
          seconds.

        - Products can define the attribute '__module_aliases__' in
          their '__init__' modules that specifies aliases for modules
          used in the product.  This is useful if module names have
          changed and the database contains pickles refering to the
          old modules.  The attribute should be a sequence of
          tuples. Each tuple has a (dotted) module name and a module.

      Bugs Fixed
 
        - Development on ZopeHTTPServer has been frozen in anticipation
          of the switch to Medusa. Therefor ZopeHTTPServer still does
          support PUT. Sorry.

        - ZPublisher.Client used the obsolete rand module.

        - Errors occuring during product import caused Zope to fail to come
          up.

        - Product version information was not displayed correctly.

        - ZGadflyDA cached table meta-data which lead to missleading
          information when browsing databases.

    Zope 1.9 beta 3

      New Features

        - Z SQL Methods (FKA Aqueduct) and the Z Gadfly Database Adapter
          are now included.

        - The argument handling for ZopeHTTPServer has been changed to 
          be a bit more flexible wrt the order of argumements.  
          While options must still come first, environment settings
          can be given in any order.  This makes startup scripts loke
          serve.py quite a bit simpler.

        - ZopeHTTPServer now sports preliminary support for PUT publishing.
          
        - ZopeHTTPServer now serves from port 9673 by default, not 8080.

      Bugs fixed

        - The start.bat file used to start ZopeHTTPServer on win32 was
          misnamed and didn't correctly pass command-line arguments.

        - Win32 machines without an existing Python installation had problems
          due to PYTHONPATH bootstrapping.

        - The included ZopeHTTPServer was failing to start correctly on
          win32 machines that were not connected to the network.

    Zope 1.9 beta 2

      In addition to various documentation updates, this release includes:

      New Features

        - Changed serve.py to accept ZopeHTTPServer command-line options.

        - Added a -P option to the ZopeHTTPServer to specify a file
          to contain the process ID.  This allows a script to stop
          the process on Unix.

        - Added support for the environment variables, Z_REALM and
          Z_DEBUG_MODE to set an authentication realm and to
          enable debug mode.

      Bugs fixed

        - External methods were broken due to differences in 
          Python 1.4 and Python 1.5 comparison semantics.

        - ZopeHTTPServer command-line environment settings
          were not available in os.environ.

        - Some class references were wrong in examples in the ExtensionClass
          documentation.

        - INSTANCE_HOME was not set correctly when the debugger was run
          with a relative path to the published module.

        - The #! line in the ZopeHTTPServer was hidden by the copyright
          statement and didn't have the right path.

        - A bug in pcgi_publisher.py caused file uploads larger than 1 MB
          to fail.

    Zope 1.9 beta 1

      Bugs fixed:

        - pcgi did not build correctly on Solaris 2.6

        - links in headers were broken when Zope was reached with
          /, as is the case when the ZopeHTTPServer is used.

        - Python sources used tabs and spaces for indentation, which
          made some people unhappy.

        - Copyright statements were missing or out of date.
        
        - Added better instructions for building and running Zope.

        - Added new Zope License and attribution information.

        - Merged BoboHTTPServer updates with ZopeHTTPServer. Including 
          socket changes to allow easier stopping and starting.

        - Shutting down the ZopeHTTPServer from the application
          caused an empty document to be returned.

        - The install scripts failed if run more than once when attempting
          to create a var directory.

      Features

        - Added (and old version of) the zlib module to make
          installation simpler.

        - Zope requires an access file.  The install scripts now create
          one.

    Zope 1.9 alpha 1 

      This was the inital Zope test release.

  Futures

    Things we plan to happen real soon (maybe next release)

      Features

       - include a serve shell script along the lines of:
   
           #!/bin/sh
           python serve.py > var/serve.log 2> var/serve.errors &
   
         Note that this script should be written by the installers
         and use sys.executable.

         (Brian)

      Bugs

       - Chase down weird bugs reported by Michel Pelletier.

    Things to do sometime

      Features

        - Better deamon management for ZopeHTTPServer, Medusa,
          and pcgi-LRP (when pcgi wrapper gets out of process
          management business).

          (Note that there is some experimental code along these
           lines in principia main.)

       - Need make_clean.py that:
   
         - runs make clobber for the extensions
   
         - runs make clean in pcgi
   
         - prints an message reminding user to manually remove var
   
         (brian)

       - The default access file should be handled a little differently.
         The installer should make people enter values, the default
         should have a randomly generated password, or the default should
         be ommitted.
