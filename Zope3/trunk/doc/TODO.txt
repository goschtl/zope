Done
----

85:  Close this issue. Jim agreed that this isn't requiered. I don't 
     think SteveA is refactoring this part. Perhaps we can open another 
     issue for Metadata, I think the Metadata views should also make use
     of the form framwork, there are still implemented as normal pages.

216: Close or reject this issue, the preview is working correctly. We need a 
     presentation skin for to fix this. It's not possible to use the index.html 
     views as a enduser UI without the ZMI. If somebody don't think so, take a 
     look at the index.html for images or files. There is no way right now
     to use index.html views in the Rotterdam skin with only zope.View permissions
     on objects. 
     This is a feature not a issue and needs a additional presentation skin.

243: This seems a old issue which was done for the 3.0 release, ri

288: I think we can ignore this issue since we don't know in which browser 
     this happen, ri

328: Added virtual host support to the xml tree. Paul and Godefroid
     will fix the issue 333,  ri

378: It's not a bug, he just tries to use a Object field without the 
     CustomWidgetFactory, ri
