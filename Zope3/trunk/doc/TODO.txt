Things to do for the next release (in no particular order)
==========================================================

- Fix final issues relating the new PAS and related UIs

- Develop a generic browser:form directive

- Support for iterable sources

- Issue 292: Add factory to browser:resource directive 

- Issue 295: Sort out defaultView 

- Issue 309: <schemadisplay> should support <widget>
