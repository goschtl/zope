============================================================
Things to do for the next release (in no particular order)
============================================================

- Implement subscription adapter support in getRegisteredMatching() method of
  adapter registry. (zope/interface/adapter.py, line 623-628)

- Merge zope.conf and zdaemon.conf. This is a Fred Drake task. :)

- Distribution, packaging an installation system.  Fred is working on
  a prototype. This will eventually inclide Zope-2 style installation,
  configuration and process management.

- Persistent interfaces

  These were broken (I think) by recent interface and adapter
  refactoring.

- Redo event service

  o Simplify publication/registration framework

  o Subscribe directly, rather than by path

  Note that, for now, we won't support local subscriptions.

- Change the way components are looked up locally:

  http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/FixedDefaultComponentLookup

- Partial adapters

  http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/PartialAdapters

- Minor refactoring of security context

  http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/UnificationOfRequestsAndSecurityContextsThroughUse

- Redo utility service

- Restructure registration framework to use direct references rather
  than paths.

- Finish location-relevent event work;
  specifically, handling events on containers.  

  See:
   http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/LocationRelatedEvents

- Finish http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/ComponentArchitectureSimplification

  What remains is the section "Utilities everywhere".

  - Query

- Redo the way names input in add forms.  Rather than have adding
  provide an add button, either:

  - Have it provide the name of an input field.  If the name
    is false, then no name can be entered, otherwise, an input
    with that name must be supplied by the form.

    or

  - Have the adding provide a boolean saying whether a name should
    be collected. The add form takes over responsibility and sets
    contentName.

- Replace the *used* names in schema.errornames to exceptions
  in schema.interfaces.  Deprecate schema.errornames.

- Sort out the dependency of zope.schema on zopei18nmessageid.
  Do we really need to create messageids in zope.schema?
  Maybe we do. Maybe i18n *is* that fundamental. 

- Write a README.txt for zope.i18nmessageid.

- http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/LifeCycleEvents

- Permission rationalization

  Absent deep thinking, then create a set of fine-grained permission
  and a default permission redefinition that makes them course grained
