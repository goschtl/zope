Done
----

85:  Close this issue. Jim agreed that this isn't requiered. I don't 
     think SteveA is refactoring this part. Perhaps we can open another 
     issue for Metadata, I think the Metadata views should also make use
     of the form framwork, there are still implemented as normal pages.

216: Close this issue, the preview is working correctly.

243: This seems a old issue which was done for the 3.0 release, ri

328 + 333: Replaced the xmltree with the static tree, don't close 
     this is only not relevant for the 3.1 release since we use the 
     static tree, ri

378: It's not a bug, he just tries to use a Object field without the 
     CustomWidgetFactory, ri
