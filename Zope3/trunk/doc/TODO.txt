============================================================
Things to do for the next release (in no particular order)
============================================================

- Remove the workflow service, which is just a wrapper around the
  utility service.

- http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/NoMoreSchemaBinding

- http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/CleanupOfSchemaAndWidgets

- http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/SupportingConstraintMaintainingSubscriptions

  This is needed for a number of other tasks.  Nathan Yergler is
  working on this.

- Merge zope.conf and zdaemon.conf. This is a Fred Drake task. :)

- Distribution, packaging an installation system.  Fred is working on
  a prototype. This will eventually inclide Zope-2 style installation,
  configuration and process management.

- Redo event service

  o Simplify publication/registration framework

  o Subscribe directly, rather than by path

  Note that, for now, we won't support local subscriptions.

- Change the way components are looked up locally:

  http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/FixedDefaultComponentLookup

- Partial adapters

  http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/PartialAdapters

  Maybe we can live without these.

- Minor refactoring of security context

  http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/UnificationOfRequestsAndSecurityContextsThroughUse

  Steve and Marius are working on this

- Redo utility service

- Restructure registration framework to use direct references rather
  than paths.

- Finish location-relevent event work;
  specifically, handling events on containers.  

  See:
   http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/LocationRelatedEvents

- Redo the way names input in add forms.

  See: http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/AddingNameControl

  K. Narasimha Murthy is working on this.

- http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/LifeCycleEvents

- Permission rationalization

  Absent deep thinking, then create a set of fine-grained permission
  and a default permission redefinition that makes them course grained
