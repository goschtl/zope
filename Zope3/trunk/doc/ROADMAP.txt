  Zope X3.0.0 Milestone release 3

    The third milestone release will probably happen around mid-May
    2003.  We may skip this release and have an alpha around the
    beginning of June instead.

    The goals of the second alpha release release are to:

    - Evolve the Zope 3 UI.

    - Flesh out through the web development and configuration.

    - Provide a relatively firm foundation for beginner Zope 3
      developers who want to start building Zope 3 products or to
      contribute to development.  

    - Provide support for web "scriptors", who are creators of active
      content. 

    - Provide wider exposure of Zope 3.

    - Solicit input on features, current and missing.


    New Features

      - A number of new services will be included:

        - A flexible and pluggable authentication service.

        - Interface service, for browsing and changing configuration
          by interface.  This will include focussed browsing and
          configuration of "content types".

      - A file-system synchronization system.  Initially, this will
        use a CVS-like command-line tool.  It allows objects to be checked out
        of Zope to the file system, modified and then checked back
        in. Objects can be added on the file systems and changes made
        in the database and on the file-system can be merged.
