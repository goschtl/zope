  Zope 3x.0.0 alpha 2

    The second alpha release will probably happen around the begining
    of February 2003. 

    The goals of the second alpha release release are to:

    - Evolve the Zope 3 UI.

    - Flesh out through the web development and configuration.

    - Provide a relatively firm foundation for beginner Zope 3
      developers who want to start building Zope 3 products or to
      contribute to development.  

    - Provide wider exposure of Zope 3.

    - Solicit input on features, current and missing.

    The alpha release may be slow. We have intentionally avoided
    optimization to keep the code as clean as possible. Optimization
    will be performed prior to the first beta release.

    New Features

      - A number of new services will be included:

        - A flexible and pluggable authentication service.

        - Virtual host service

        - Interface service, for browsing and changing configuration
          by interface.

        - Some sort of mail delivery service service

      - A file-system synchronization system.  Initially, this will
        use a CVS-like command-line tool.  It allows objects to be checked out
        of Zope to the file system, modified and then checked back
        in. Objects can be added on the file systems and changes made
        in the database and on the file-system can be merged.

      - WebDAV support would be nice.
