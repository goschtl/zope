Zope Road Map

  This file lists features or tasks planned for future releases. It is roughly
  the compliment of CHANGES.txt. Over time, entries from this file
  will migrate to CHANGES.txt and then to HISTORY.txt.

  Zope X3 1.0

    Foundational work

      - ZODB 3.3 in Zope 3

        See: http://zope.org/Wikis/ZODB/PersistentCodeImplementationPlan

      - Persistent interfaces

        These were broken (I think) by recent interface and adapter
        refactoring.

      - Redo event service

        o Simplify publication/registration framework

        o Subscribe directly, rather than by path

      - Maybe: http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/FixedDefaultComponentLookup

        This is extremely controversial


      - Partial adapters

        http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/PartialAdapters

      - Fix up presentation-component franeworks to use presentation
        components registered by interface.

      - Revisit and, to degree necessary, implement:

        http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/TTWDevelopmentScopeForZopeX310

        I think we probably need to scale back out expectations for the code
        to:

        - Persistent modules

        - Local browser menus

        - Views

        - Adapters

        - Management of database-based services and utilities.

        - File-system sync

        Configuration browsing and management.

        IOW, clean up what we already have.

        We probably need to defer:

        - Bundles

        - New content types

        - Local factories

        Current efforts could continue to be pursued as add-on items.

      - Redo object hub

      - Minor refactoring of security context

        http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/UnificationOfRequestsAndSecurityContextsThroughUse

      - Redo menu service

        http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/AdaptersForMenuItems
        http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/PartialAdapters

      - Maybe rethink annotations (maybe not ;)

      - Finish persistent-module refactoring

        http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/ModulesAreGlobal

      - Minor refactoring of adapter service to make it fast to find 
        all names for adapters from/to a given interface

      - Redo utility service

      - Restructure registration framework to use direct references rather
        than paths.

      - Finish location-relevent event work to handle

        Specifically, handling events on containers.  

        See:
         http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/LocationRelatedEvents

      - Finish http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/ComponentArchitectureSimplification

        What remains is the section "Utilities everywhere".

        - Language negotiation

        - Translation (?)  Note that if these were utilities, you could
          have independent utilities prt domain

        - Caching (Naveen is working on this)

        - SQL Database connections (Mostly done, but Madhavi and Mohan
          working on new UI).

        - DAV schema

        - Interface (Murthy and Suresh are working on these)

        - Vocabularies (warn Gary and Casey :)

        - Roles

        - Permissions

        - Session data managers

        - Workflow definitions

        - Rendered source types

        - Interpreter types

        - Mail

        - HubIDs

        We need to think about the UI for managing these.  For example, a
        site manager is likely to want to "Manage Database
        Connections". They probably don't want to think of these in terms of
        utilities.

      - Maybe redo form machinery

        The existing form implementation is neither as clean or as flexible
        as it should be, but it might be OK for the first release.

      - Finish DAV?

      - Finish/cleanup XML-RPC (?)

      - Clean up zope.app by moving many things out

    Scriptor support

      What do we need for 1.0?  

      I think we need to at least port (or reimplement) Evan's ZPT
      adapter work.

    Finishing

      - Fix bugs 

      - Fix UI

      - Provide Zope-2 style installation, configuration and process
        management.
