Zope Road Map

  This file lists fratures planned for future releases. It is roughly
  the compliment of CHANGES.txt. Over time, entries from this file
  will migrate to CHANGES.txt and then to HISTORY.txt.

  Zope 3x.0.0 alpha 1

    The alpha 1 release will be the first Zope 3 release. The goals of
    this release are to:

    - Provide a relatively firm foundation for beginner Zope 3
      developers who want to start building Zope 3 products or to
      contribute to development.  

    - Provide wider exposure of Zope 3.

    - Solicit input on features, current and missing.

    The alpha release may be slow. We have intentionally avoided
    optimization to keep the code as clean as possible. Optimization
    will be performed prior to the first beta release.

    Features

      - An initial management interface including folders and various
        content types such as files, images, DTML pages, ZPT pages,
        and SQL scripts.

        It is likely that the default interface will be ugly. We
        encourage folks to help us beautify it.

      - A framework for configuring and installing file-system-based
        products. 

      - A through-the-web configuration and development system based
        on services. Services are similar to CMF tools except that
        they are managed in service managers, rather than in folders.

        A number of predefined services will be included:

        - Simple authentication service (similar to Zope 2's
          original user folder).

        - Event service.

        - RDB Connection service. This is used to manage database
          connection objects used by SQL scripts.

        - Translation service, to manage software (as opposed to
          content) translation services.

        - Caching service.

        - Site error reporting service (like Zope 2's site error log)

        - Browser ID service

        - Temporary Data service (similar to a Zope 2 temporary
          folder)

        - Session service

        - Virtual host service

        - Role service
 
        - Interface service, for browsing and changing configuration
          by interface.

        - Adapter service

        - View services

        - Some of mail delivery service service

        - Object Hub, which tracks object locations, allowing
          location-independent object references

        - Indexing service, supporting pluggable indexes and searching

        Through the web development will take place in packages, which
        can contain:

        - Persistent python modules

        - Templates

        - Component instances 

        - Configuration objects

        Configuration objects are used to configure component
        instances and component factories and register with the
        appropriate services.

      - A file-system synchronization system.  Initially, this will
        use a CVS-like command-line tool.  It allows objects to be checked out
        of Zope to the file system, modified and then checked back
        in. Objects can be added on the file systems and changes made
        in the database and on the file-system can be merged.
