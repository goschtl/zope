The grant directive

Overview

  It is used to do the following:

    * grant permissions to principals

    * associate permissions with roles

    * assign roles to principals

  Ultimately, this is all to do with granting permissions, so the grant
  directive is used for all of these.

Attributes

  The grant directive has three possible attributes
  
    * permission, a permission's id
  
    * principal, a principal's id
  
    * role, a role's id
  
  However, only these combinations are valid
  
    * permission - role
    
    * permission - principal
    
    * role - principal

  Note that the permissions, principals and roles need to be defined
  elsewhere using the permission, role and principal directives.

Examples

  Here are some examples of using the grant directive::
  
    <grant permission="zope.View" principal="zope.Bob" />
  
    <grant role="zope.Manager" principal="zope.Bob" />
