  Define a group of browser menu items

  This directive is useful when many menu items are defined for the same
  interface and menu.

  Attributes

    menu -- TextLine (required)

      Menu name

      The (name of the) menu the items are defined for

    for -- GlobalObject (optional, default=None)

      The interface the menu items are defined for


  Subdirectives

    menuItem

      File zope/app/publisher/browser/meta.zcml, lines 116 - 119.

      Define a menu item within a group of menu items

      Attributes

        action -- TextLine (required)

          The relative url to use if the item is selected

          The url is relative to the object the menu is being displayed for.

        title -- MessageID (required)

          Title

          The text to be displayed for the menu item

        description -- MessageID (optional, default=None)

          A longer explanation of the menu item

          A UI may display this with the item or display it when the user
          requests more assistance.

        permission -- Id (optional, default=None)

          The permission needed access the item

          This can usually be inferred by the system, however, doing so may be
          expensive. When displaying a menu, the system tries to traverse to
          the URLs given in each action to determine whether the url is
          accessible to the current user. This can be avoided if the
          permission is given explicitly.

        filter -- TextLine (optional, default=None)

          A condition for displaying the menu item

          The condition is given as a TALES expression. The expression has
          access to the variables:

          context -- The object the menu is being displayed for

          request -- The browser request

          nothing -- None

          The menu item will not be displayed if there is a filter and the
          filter evaluates to a false value.
