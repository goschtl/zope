  Defines a browser resource

  Attributes

    layer -- TextLine (optional, default=None)

      The layer the resource should be found in

      For information on layers, see the documentation for the skin directive.
      Defaults to "default".

    permission -- Id (optional, default=None)

      The permission needed to access the resource.

      If a permission isn't specified, the resource will always be accessible.

    name -- TextLine (required)

      The name of the resource

      This is the name used in resource urls. Resource urls are of the form
      site/@@/resourcename, where site is the url of "site", a folder with a
      service manager.

      We make resource urls site-relative (as opposed to content-relative) so
      as not to defeat caches.

    file -- Path (optional, default=None)

      File

      The file containing the resource data.

    image -- Path (optional, default=None)

      Image

      If the image attribute is used, then an image resource, rather than a
      file resource will be created.

    template -- Path (optional, default=None)

      Template

      If the image attribute is used, then a page template resource, rather
      than a file resource will be created.
