Things to do After Zope X3.0

- Support for groups in the security model. No one has been
  interested in working on this and, at this point, there are
  too many other things to do. We *are* committed to adding this
  eventually. 

- Support for permission catagories in the security model. No
  one has been interested in working on this and, at this point,
  there are too many other things to do. We *are* committed to
  adding this eventually assuming that it becomes necessary due
  to a lerge number of permissions.

- Support for executable identity / code ownership.
  I'm not positive that anybody actually wants this. :)

- Better ZPT debugging support

  It's sometimes hard to tell where the pieces that make up a
  page come from.  We'll investigate:

  - Leaving TAL and METAL markup in the ooutput and

  - Including special sourcxe attributes that record locations
    of objects used in expressions.

- DTML2

  DTML2 is a version of DTML that uses TALES *instead* of the
  traditional DTML namespace stack and expression mechanisms.
