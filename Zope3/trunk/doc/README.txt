Introduction:

  The source release is intended for tinkerers, those who want
  to use Zope components separately, Bobo hackers, and people
  who aren't afraid of programming.

  If you just want to use Zope easily and aren't a programmer
  the binary release will probably suit you better.

License

  A preliminary version of the Zope License is included in docs/LICENSE.txt
  We are still working on finalizing the license. Send your feeback about
  the license to paul@digicool.com

Installing Zope:

  Follow the instructions in INSTALL.txt to install Zope. You
  may wish to run the installer even if you only plan on using
  selected Zope components since the install script compiles
  Python extensions for you that you may want, like cDocumentTemplate.

Using Zope Components Separately

  Zope consists of many Python packages which can be profitably
  used by themselves. For example you will find all your old friends
  from Bobo here:

    * ZPublisher - A packagized version of the Bobo ORB you know and
      love. It's been updated with new thinks like support for
      __bobo_debug_mode__ More info to come soon.

    * DocumentTemplate - This package includes cDocumentTemplate which
      speeds things up considerably.

    * BoboPOS - This is NOT BoboPOS3. It a version of BoboPOS2 which
      include c code to make things faster.

  You can find most of these packages in the lib/python directory. If
  you poke around, you might find other goodies too, like StructuredText.

  We plan on making separate releases of these packages soon.

Notes:

  * Zope requires Python 1.5.1
  * Lots more documentation is coming.
  * Don't forget to check the Zope web site and mailing list.
  * Read the source, have fun!
