The **zbundle create** Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Synopsis
++++++++

**create** [**-f** *factory*] [**-t** *type*] *bundle* *source*

Description
+++++++++++

Create a bundle from a site management folder or another bundle.  The
bundle will only be created if the container is a site management
folder.  *bundle* must be a valid bundle name.

The contents of *source* are copied into the newly created bundle, and
are scheduled for addition to the database.  The new bundle can be
manipulated using **zsync add** and **zsync revert** (as well as just
editing the contents) as needed before committing it to the database.

Options
+++++++

-f factory, --factory factory
  Specify the object factory to use for the object being added.

-t type, --type type           
  The type of the object to be created.  Normally only *factory* needs
  to be specified, if the default isn't sufficient.


The **zbundle help** Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Synopsis
++++++++

**help** [*command* ...]

Description
+++++++++++

When used without specifying *command*, this displays general help on
using **zbundle**.  When *command* is given, information about each
command listed is presented.


Security Notes
--------------

**zbundle** does not introduce any new security issues beyond those
inherent in |zsync|_.  Refer to the |zsync|_ documentation for
details on security issues.


Files
-----

**zbundle** does not create any supplemental files beyond what
|zsync|_ produces.  Refer to the |zsync|_ documentation for details on
those files.


Reporting Bugs
--------------

Bugs in **zbundle** and the filesystem synchronization support in Zope 3
should be reported via the `Zope 3 Development Issue Collector`_, an
online reporting tool that allows you to enter reports directly into
our bug-tracking system.


See Also
--------

If you're interested in using **zbundle**, you should be familiar with
|zsync|_.

There are two interesting and directly relevant articles in the `Zope 3
wiki`_:

* The |FSSYNC|_ is the initial proposal for a way to synchronize
  copies of a Zope-based website between a filesystem-based
  representation and the database backing the live site.

* Bundles are discussed in |TTWSITE|_; this gives more information on
  the motivation and goals surrounding this work.
