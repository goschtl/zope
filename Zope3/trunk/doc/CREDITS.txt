  Zope 3 has been a Zope Community effort!  It wouldn't exist without
  the many fine contributions, in many forms, by many people.
  In fact, so many people have helped out in so many important it's
  impossible to give everybody the credit they deserve, but I'll make
  a start.
  
  o A good bit of the Zope 3 development has taken place in Zope 3
    sprints. 

    - The earliest sprints were held at Zope Corporation. Tres Seaver
      was instrumental in helping us figure out this format and
      teaching me the XP process.

    - Chris Wither's and NIP hosted the first European sprint in
      London in February 2002.

    - Alastair Burt hosted a workflow sprint in Saarbruecken, Germany,
      in March 2002. 

    - NetAid (Josh Kutz, Nikheel Dhekne) hosted a sprint in New York
      in March 2002.

    - Beehive hosted a sprint in Berlin in April 2002.

    - EuroPython/EuroZope hosted a large sprint in conjunction with
      the EuroPython conference.

    - ZeOmega hosted an extended development session in Bangalore.
      We worked out a number of ideas for the (still early) through
      the web configuration and development environment.  We moved
      file-system synchronization forward. And we ported several
      facilities from Zope 2.

    - Infrae (Kit Blake, Martijn Faasen and others) hosted a truly
      amazing and productive event, the Infrae Sprintathon,
      http://www.infrae.com/sprintathon, in December 2002. I think
      that this qualifies as the first Zope 3 Hackers Workshop. I hope
      there will be more.

    - Code Works hosted a sprint, led by Steve Alexander, in Vilnius,
      immediately after the sprintathon.

  o Steve Alexander has provided tremendous leadership, along with his
    many other contributions, in design, code, to say nothing of moral
    support. 

  o Stephan Richter helped launch Zope 3 with abundant energy and
    enthusiasm, as well as many software and documentation contributions. 

  o Shane Hathaway created some of the initial prototypes of Zope 3
    and was an important brainstorming partner before we went "public"
    with Zope 3. He has remained a stalwart but quiet contributor,
    despite his heavy workload at Zope Corporation.

  o Python Labs: Guido van Rossum, Fred Drake, Jeremy Hylton, Tim
    Peters, and Barry Warsaw have been crucial contributors to Zope 3
    since it was just a bunch of stray ideas floating around.

  o Gary Poster has made significant contributions in a variety of
    areas, including the object hub and event service.

  o David Murray has been a constant source of well-thought feedback,
    suggestions, and ideas. 

  o Sidnei da Silva created the first attractive skin for Zope 3. 

  o Kapil Thangavelu, David Murray, Sidnei da Silva, and PythonLabs
    made the grand renaming possible. Kapil wrote the scripts that did
    most of the work and the team made Zope work again.

  o The folks at Codeworks, Albertas Agejevas, Marius Gedminas, and
    Viktorija Zaksiene and contributed major parts of Zope, especially
    the relational database support and caching infrustructure. Much
    thanks to M Carling for making their time available.

  o Much thanks to Alexander Limi, Alan Runyan, Godefroid Chapelle,
    Joachim Werner, Paul Everitt, and others for the "Rotterdam Skin",
    the default skin in Zope 3.  Special thanks to Godefroid
    for the finishing work just before the alpha.


I know I've left out some important contributors. I've run out of
time. Watch this space!

Much thanks!
Jim Fulton
