Building and installing Zope

  This document describes buiding and installing Zope on Unix.
  We will provide Windows instructions in later releases.
  
  There are some python scripts in the top-level directory that should
  help you get started.  You must run these scripts from the top-level
  directory.

  If you want to try out zope in the simplest fashion using a 
  Python web server, then run the script wo_pcgi::

    python wo_pcgi.py

  then to start the web server, run the serve script::

    python serve.py

  If you want to use PCGI and an existing web server, run w_pcgi::

    python w_pcgi.py

  and configure the web server appropriately.
