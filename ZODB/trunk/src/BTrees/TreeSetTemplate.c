  7. Modifications are encouraged but must be packaged separately as
     patches to official Zope releases.  Distributions that do not
     clearly separate the patches from the original work must be clearly
     labeled as unofficial distributions.  Modifications which do not
     carry the name Zope may be packaged in any form, as long as they
     conform to all of the clauses above.
