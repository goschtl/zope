  3. Digital Creations requests that attribution be given to Zope
     in any manner possible. Zope includes a "Powered by Zope"
     button that is installed by default. While it is not a license
     violation to remove this button, it is requested that the
     attribution remain. A significant investment has been put
     into Zope, and this effort will continue if the Zope community
     continues to grow. This is one way to assure that growth.
  
  4. All advertising materials and documentation mentioning
     features derived from or use of this software must display
     the following acknowledgement:
  
       "This product includes software developed by Digital Creations
       for use in the Z Object Publishing Environment
       (http://www.zope.org/)."
  
     In the event that the product being advertised includes an
     intact Zope distribution (with copyright and license included)
     then this clause is waived.
  
  5. Names associated with Zope or Digital Creations must not be used to
     endorse or promote products derived from this software without
     prior written permission from Digital Creations.

     Intact (re-)distributions of any official Zope release do not
     require an external acknowledgement.
  
  7. Modifications are encouraged but must be packaged separately as
     patches to official Zope releases.  Distributions that do not
     clearly separate the patches from the original work must be clearly
     labeled as unofficial distributions.  Modifications which do not
     carry the name Zope may be packaged in any form, as long as they
     conform to all of the clauses above.
