Zope Enterprize Objects

  Put this package (the ZEO directory, without any wrapping directory
  included in a distribution) in your Zope lib/python.

  Starting (and configuring) the ZEO Server

    To start the storage server, go to your Zope install directory and::

      python lib/python/ZEO/start.py -p port_number

    (Run start without arguments to see options.)

    Of course, the server and the client don't have to be on the same
    machine.

    If the server and client *are* on the same machine, then you can use 
    a Unix domain socket::

      python lib/python/ZEO/start.py -U filename

    The start script provides a number of options not documented here.
    See doc/start.txt for more information.
        
  Running Zope as a ZEO client

    To get Zope to use the server, create a custom_zodb module,
    custom_zodb.py, in your Zope install directory, so that Zope uses a
    ClientStorage::

      import ZEO.ClientStorage
      Storage=ZEO.ClientStorage.ClientStorage(('',port_number))

    (See the misc/custom_zodb.py for an example.)

    You can specify a host name (rather than '') if you want.  The port
    number is, of course, the port number used to start the storage
    server.

    You can also give the name of a Unix domain socket file::

      import ZEO.ClientStorage
      Storage=ZEO.ClientStorage.ClientStorage(filename)

    There are a number of configuration options available for the
    ClientStorage. See doc/ClientStorage.txt for details.

    If you want a persistent client cache which retains cache contents
    across ClientStorage restarts, you need to define the environment
    variable, ZEO_CLIENT, to a unique name for the client.  This is
    needed so that unique cache name files can be computed.  Otherwise,
    the client cache is stored in temporary files which are removed when
    the ClientStorage shuts down.  For example, to start two Zope
    processes with unique caches, use something like:

      python z2.py -P8700 ZEO_CLIENT=8700
      python z2.py -P8800 ZEO_CLIENT=8800

  Zope product installation

    Normally, Zope updates the Zope database during startup to reflect
    product changes or new products found. It makes no sense for
    multiple ZEO clients to do the same installation. Further, if
    different clients have different software installed, the correct
    state of the database is ambiguous.

    Starting in Zope 2.2, Zope will not modify the Zope database
    during product installation if the environment variable ZEO_CLIENT
    is set. 

    Normally, Zope ZEO clients should be run with ZEO_CLIENT set so
    that product initialization is not performed.

    If you do install new Zope products, then you need to take a
    special step to cause the new products to be properly registered
    in the database.  The easiest way to do this is to start Zope
    once without ZEO_CLIENT set.

    The interaction between ZEO and Zope product installation is
    unfortunate.  In the future, this interaction will be removed by
