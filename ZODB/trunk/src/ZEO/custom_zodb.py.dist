# First we have to get the right ZEO components 
import ZEO.ClientStorage

# Lets set this in variables

ZSS_HOST = ''                           # Host name where ZSS is running
ZSS_PORT = 8800                         # Port that the ZSS is running on
ZSS_ASYNC = 1                           # Set to 1 for async calls
ZSS_NAME = 'MyStorage'                  # 

# Now we tell Zope where its storage is:
Storage=ZEO.ClientStorage.ClientStorage((ZSS_HOST, ZSS_PORT),
                                        async=ZSS_ASYNC, name=ZSS_NAME)
