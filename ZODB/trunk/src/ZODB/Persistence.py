    Persistent object support mix-in class

    When a persistent object is loaded from a database, the object's
    data is not immediately loaded.  Loading of the objects data is
    defered until an attempt is made to access an attribute of the
    object. 

    The object also tries to keep track of whether it has changed.  It
    is easy for this to be done incorrectly.  For this reason, methods
    of subclasses that change state other than by setting attributes
    should: 'self.__changed__(1)' to flag instances as changed.

    Data are not saved automatically.  To save an object's state, call
    the object's '__save__' method.

    You must not override the object's '__getattr__' and '__setattr__'
    methods.  If you override the objects '__getstate__' method, then
    you must be careful not to include any attributes with names
    starting with '_p_' in the state.
