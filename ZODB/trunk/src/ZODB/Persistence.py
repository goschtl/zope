	Persistent object support mix-in class
    
	When a persistent object is loaded from a database, the object's
	data is not immediately loaded.  Loading of the objects data is
	defered until an attempt is made to access an attribute of the
	object. 
    
	The object also tries to keep track of whether it has changed.  It
	is easy for this to be done incorrectly.  For this reason, methods
	of subclasses that change state other than by setting attributes
	should: 'self.__changed__(1)' to flag instances as changed.
    
	You must not override the object's '__getattr__' and '__setattr__'
	methods.  If you override the objects '__getstate__' method, then
	you must be careful not to include any attributes with names
	starting with '_p_' in the state.
