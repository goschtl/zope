"""Very Simple Mapping ZODB storage

The Mapping storage provides an extremely simple storage
implementation that doesn't provide undo or version support.

It is meant to illustrate the simplest possible storage.

The Mapping storage uses a single data structure to map
object ids to data.

The Demo storage serves two purposes:

  - Provide an example implementation of a full storage without
    distracting storage details,

  - Provide a volatile storage that is useful for giving demonstrations.

The demo strorage can have a "base" storage that is used in a
read-only fashion. The base storage must not not to contain version
data.

There are three main data structures:

  _data -- Transaction logging information necessary for undo

      This is a mapping from transaction id to transaction, where
      a transaction is simply a 4-tuple:

        packed, user, description, extension_data, records

      where extension_data is a dictionary or None and records are the
      actual records in chronological order. Packed is a flag
      indicating whethe the transaction has been packed or not

  _index -- A mapping from oid to record

  _vindex -- A mapping from version name to version data

      where version data is a mapping from oid to record

A record is a tuple:

  oid, serial, pre, vdata, p, 

where:

     oid -- object id

     serial -- object serial number

     pre -- The previous record for this object (or None)

     vdata -- version data

        None if not a version, ortherwise:
           version, non-version-record

     p -- the pickle data or None

The pickle data will be None for a record for an object created in
an aborted version.

It is instructive to watch what happens to the internal data structures
as changes are made.  Foe example, in Zope, you can create an external
method::

  import Zope

  def info(RESPONSE):
      RESPONSE['Content-type']= 'text/plain'

      return Zope.DB._storage._splat()

and call it to minotor the storage.
