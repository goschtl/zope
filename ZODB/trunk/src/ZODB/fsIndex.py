"""Implement an OID to File-position (long integer) mapping."""

# To save space, we do two things:
#
#     1. We split the keys (OIDS) into 6-byte prefixes and 2-byte suffixes.
#        We use the prefixes as keys in a mapping from prefix to mappings
#        of suffix to data:
#
#           data is  {prefix -> {suffix -> data}}
#
#     2. We limit the data size to 48 bits. This should allow databases
#        as large as 256 terabytes.
#
# Most of the space is consumed by items in the mappings from 2-byte
# suffix to 6-byte data. This should reduce the overall memory usage to
# 8-16 bytes per OID.
#
# Since the mapping from suffix to data contains at most 256 entries,
# we use a BTree bucket instead of a full BTree to store the results.
#
# We use p64 to convert integers to 8-byte strings and lop off the two
# high-order bytes when saving. On loading data, we add the leading
# bytes back before using u64 to convert the data back to (long)
# integers.
