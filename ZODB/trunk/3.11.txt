Wish list for 3.11.

These aren't promises, but things I'd like to do:

- ZEO support for loading blobs via HTTP.

- Allow ZEO ports to be given as strings

- ZEO cache fix for loadBefore.

- invalidation events.

- Persistent sets.

- PxBTrees, persistent objects as keys in BTrees.

  - Compare on persistent references.

- Python BTrees and persistence.
