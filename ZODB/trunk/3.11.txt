Wish list for 3.11.

These aren't promises, but things I'd like to do:

- ZEO support for loading blobs via HTTP.

- ZEO cache fix for loadBefore.

- invalidation events.

- Make DBs context manager, so in a simple script, one could do:

  with ZEO.DB(someaddr) as connection:
      do some things in a transaction. Commit and close at the end.

- Persistent sets.

- PxBTrees, persistent objects as keys in BTrees.

  - Compare on persistent references.

- Python BTrees and persistence.

- JSONic read-only mode where you can read most objects for which you
  don't have classes as long at they have the default getstate.
  This might be as simple as using a variation of broken objects.
