This directory contains Andrew Kuchling's programmers guide to ZODB
and ZEO.  It is taken from Andrew's zodb.sf.net project on
SourceForge.  The SF version should be considered the canonical
version, so don't make edits here for now.

Eventually, we'll finish merging the two projects and then the version
here will be the canonical one.  For now, we have to manually keep the
two directories in sync.
