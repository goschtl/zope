What's new in ZODB3 3.7a1?
==========================
Release date: DD-MMM-200Y


Following is combined news from internal releases (to support ongoing
Zope development).  These are the dates of the internal releases:

- 3.7a1 DD-MMM-200Y

Connection management
---------------------

- (3.7a1) When more than ``pool_size`` connections have been closed,
  ``DB`` forgets the excess (over ``pool_size``) connections closed first.
  Python's cyclic garbage collection can take "a long time" to reclaim them
  (and may in fact never reclaim them if application code keeps strong
  references to them), but such forgotten connections can never be opened
  again, so their caches are now cleared at the time ``DB`` forgets them.
  Most applications won't notice a difference, but applications that open
  many connections, and/or store many large objects in connection caches,
  and/or store limited resources (such as RDB connections) in connection
  caches may benefit.

Documentation
-------------

- (3.7a1) Thanks to Stephan Richter for converting many of the doctest
  files to ReST format.  These are now chapters in the Zope 3 apidoc too.

IPersistent
-----------

- (3.7a1) The documentation for ``_p_oid`` now specifies the concrete
  type of oids (in short, an oid is either None or a non-empty string).

Tools
-----

- (3.7a1) The changeover from zLOG to the logging module means that some
  tools need to perform minimal logging configuration themselves. Changed
  the zeoup script to do so and thus enable it to emit error messages.

BTrees
------

- (3.7a1) Suppressed warnings about signedness of characters when
  compiling under GCC 4.0.x.  See http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/2027.

Connection
----------

- (3.7a1) An optimization for loading non-current data (MVCC) was
  inadvertently disabled in ``_setstate()``; this has been repaired.

persistent
----------

- (3.7a1) Suppressed warnings about signedness of characters when
  compiling under GCC 4.0.x.  See http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/2027.

After Commit hooks
------------------

- (3.7a1) Transaction objects have a new method,
  ``addAfterCommitHook(hook, *args, **kws)``.  Hook functions
  registered with a transaction are called after the transaction
  commits or aborts. For example, one might want to launch non
  transactional or asynchrnonous code after a successful, or aborted,
  commit. See ``test_afterCommitHook()`` in
  ``transaction/tests/test_transaction.py`` for a tutorial doctest,
  and the ``ITransaction`` interface for details.
