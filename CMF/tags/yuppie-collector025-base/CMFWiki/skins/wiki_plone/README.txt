This is just the original Plone skin for CMFWiki, it works well, 
but is not going to be part of Plone Core anymore. I'm donating it to 
whoever wants to maintain it. I hope I'm not being rude when I check 
this into the CMF repository. It's not hooked up to anything yet, but
can easily be in the Install.py - check if the site is a Plone site,
and install this skin if it is.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
