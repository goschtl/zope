To-do:

 o 10/14/2001 klm: Email implemented.  Have to incorporate andrews
   work on search (and make it a return-to-self, single form
   activity), and implement issue edit.  Still some workflow bugs to
   resolve!

 o 10/12/2001 klm: Workflow done.  Andrew helped with a start on
   searching (not yet checked in).  Still todo: complete search, email
   notification, issue edit, maybe issue subscription

 o 10/10/2001 klm: Basic content types implemented.  Working on
   workflow (prototyping with through-the-web DCWorkflow, but not yet
   packaging that), searching, email, and assignment, but checking in
   the base pieces.

 o 09/24/2001 klm: Implementation.  (Designs at
   http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/CollectorReplacement/FrontPage .)
