  New Features

    - (__future__) Exposed role management for manager users on
      the default roster:  managers can now "promote" members
      without going to the ZMI.

    - (__future__) Added "custom schema" mechanism for content
      objetcts:  site managers can now define additional
      propertysheets for a content type, which will then be
      reflected in instances created from the type.

    - (__future__) Added simple link extraction / checking for
      textual content.  Link checking also works for Link objects.

    - (__future__) Added "composite content" types (see the
      "dogbowl proposal",
      (http://cmf.zope.org/rqmts/proposals/compounds/compoundproposal.txt).

    - (__future__) Added DCWorkflow (through-the-web configurable
      workflows) to the core set of CMF products.

    - Enabled querying actions from workflow tool in absence
      of actions tool (Tracker #401).

  Bug Fixes

    - Made links emitted by 'topic_view' play nice with virtual hosting
      (Tracker #433).

    - Ensure that package initialization files are non-empty, to prevent
      suspicion that they were corrupted in download (Tracker #426).
