Installing CMFCollector

  The CMFCollector is an issue collector for Zope.

  Prerequisites:

   - Zope, 2.4 or better (Python 2.x) and the following addons.

   - The CMF

     http://cmf.zope.org - recent (as of 10/10/2001) CVS HEAD
     checkout, or 1.2 or better (not yet released as of Oct 15, 2001).

   - Zope Page templates

     "ZPT", http://www.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZPT - ZPT is
     integrated in the Zope HEAD checkout, and will be part of the
     distribution as of Zope 2.5.

   - CMF/CMFDecor provisions for ZPT, including use of the ZPT skin as the
     default skin (settable from the portal_skins 'Properties' tab).

     That's last bit deserves emphasis - anyone using the collector
     must be using the ZPT skin (or have the 'collector' and
     'zpt_generic' layers included on the one you're using).

   - CMF/DCWorkflow

     Proper operation depends on a patch to DCWorkflow as of Oct 15,
     2001.  The patch is in the CVS version (it's DCWorkflow.py, rev
     1.8), and will be in CMF 1.2.

  To install CMFCollector:

  - Uncompress the CMFCollector product into your zope/Products
    directory or link it there, e.g.::

    ln -s /path/to/installation /path/to/zope/Products

  - In the root of your CMFSite installation (within the ZMI), add an
    external method to the root of the CMF Site, with the following
    configuration values:

      o id: install_collector

      o title (optional): Install Collector Content Types

      o module name: CMFCollector.Install

      o function name: install

    Go to the management screen for the newly added external method and
    click the 'Try it' tab.

    The install function will execute and give information about the
    steps it took to register and install the CMF Events into the CMF
    Site instance.

  - Finally, install the workflow:

     1. Put collector_issue_workflow.zexp in your site's import/
        directory.

     2. Within the portal's portal_workflow 'Contents' tab:

        o hit the 'Import/Export' button

        o fill in Import File Name: collector_issue_workflow.zexp

        o hit 'import'

     3. Within the portal_workflow 'Workflows' tab, fill in:

        Collector Issue: collector_issue_workflow

        ... and hit the "Change" button.

   Then the workflow will be associated with any new issues you create.
