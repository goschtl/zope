Bugs fixed

* Backported decref crash fix from 2.0

* Well hidden free-while-in-use crash bug in ObjectPath

Other changes

* The test suites now run ``gc.collect()`` in the ``tearDown()``
  methods.  While this makes them take a lot longer to run, it also
  makes it easier to link a specific test to garbage collection
  problems that would otherwise appear in later tests.

z3c.coverage
============

1.1.2 (2008-04-14)
------------------

- Bug: When a package path contained anywhere the word "test", it was ignored
  from the coverage report. The intended behavior, however, was to ignore
  files that relate to setting up tests.

- Bug: Sort the results of `os.listdir()` in `README.txt` to avoid
  non-deterministic failures.

- Bug: The logic for ignoring unit and functional test modules also used to
  ignore modules and packages called `testing`.

- Change "Unit test coverage" to "Test coverage" in the title -- it works
  perfectly fine for functional tests too.

1.1.1 (2008-01-31)
------------------

- Bug: When the package was released, the test which tests the availability of
  an SVN revision number failed. Made the test more reliable.

1.1.0 (2008-01-29)
------------------

- Feature: The ``main()`` coverage report function now accepts the arguments
  of the script as a function argument, making it easier to configure the
  script from buildout.

- Feature: When the report directory does not exist, the report generator
  creates it for you.

- Feature: Eat your own dog food by creating a buildout that can create
  coverage reports.

- Bug: Improved the test coverage to 100%.

1.0.1 (2007-09-26)

1.0.3 (2007-09-11)
------------------

- Remedy brown-bag 1.0.2-release: Someone already released 1.0.2-r* instead of
  a .dev release making the 1.0.2 final too old. :/


========
z3c.form
========

1.9.0 (2008-08-26)
------------------

- Feature: Use the ``query()`` method in the widget manager to try extract a
  value. This ensures that the lookup is never failing, which is particularly
  helpful for dictionary-based data managers, where dictionaries might not
  have all keys.

- Feature: Changed the ``get()`` method of the data manager to throw an error
  when the data for the field cannot be found. Added ``query()`` method to
  data manager that returns a default value, if no value can be found.

- Feature: Deletion of widgets from field widget managers is now possible.

- Feature: Groups now produce detailed `ObjectModifiedEvent` descriptions like
  regular edit forms do. (Thanks to Carsten Senger for providing a patch.)

- Feature: The widget manager's ``extract()`` method now supports an optional
  ``setErrors`` (default value: True) flag that allows one to not set errors
  on the widgets and widget manager during data extraction. Use case: You want
  to inspect the entered data and handle errors manually.

- Bug: The ``ignoreButtons`` flag of the ``z3c.form.form.extends()`` method
  was not honored. (Thanks to Carsten Senger for providing a patch.)

- Bug: Group classes now implement ``IGroup``. This also helps with the
  detection of group instantiation. (Thanks to Carsten Senger for providing a
  patch.)

- Bug: The list of changes in a group were updated incorrectly, since it was
  assumed that groups would modify mutually exclusive interfaces. Instead of
  using an overwriting dictionary ``update()`` method, a purely additive merge
  is used now. (Thanks to Carsten Senger for providing a patch.)

- Bug: Added a widget for ``IDecimal`` field in testing setup.

- Feature: The ``z3c.form.util`` module has a new function, ``createCSSId()``
  method that generates readable ids for use with css selectors from any
  unicode string.

- Bug: The ``applyChanges()`` method in group forms did not return a changes
  dictionary, but simply a boolean. This is now fixed and the group form
  changes are now merged with the main form changes.

- Bug: Display widgets did not set the style attribute if it was
  available, even though the input widgets did set the style attribute.

1.8.2 (2008-04-24)
------------------

- Bug: Display Widgets added spaces (due to code indentation) to the displayed
  values, which in some cases, like when displaying Python source code, caused
  the appearance to be incorrect.

- Bug: Prevent to call ``__len__`` on ``ITerms`` and use ``is None`` for check
  for existence. Because ``__len__`` is not a part of the ITerms API and ``not
  widget.terms`` will end in calling ``__len__`` on existing terms.

1.8.1 (2008-04-08)
------------------

- Bug: Fixed a bug that prohibited groups from having different contents than
  the parent form.  Previously, the groups contents were not being properly
  updated. Added new documentation on how to use groups to generate
  object-based sub-forms. Thanks to Paul Carduner for providing the fix and
  documentation.

1.8.0 (2008-01-23)
------------------

- Feature: Implemented ``IDisplayForm`` interface.

- Feature: Added integration tests for form interfaces. Added default class
  attribute called ``widgets`` in form class with default value ``None``. This
  helps to pass the integration tests. Now, the ``widgets`` attribute can also
  be used as a indicator for updated forms.

- Feature: Implemented additional ``createAndAdd`` hook in ``AddForm``. This
  allows you to implement create and add in a single method. It also supports
  graceful abortion of a create and add process if we do not return the new
  object. This means it can also be used as a hook for custom error messages
  for errors happen during create and add.

- Feature: Add a hidden widget template for the ``ISelectWidget``.

- Feature: Arrows in the ordered select widget replaced by named entities.

- Feature: Added ``CollectionSequenceDataConverter`` to ``setupFormDefaults``.

- Feature: Templates for the CheckBox widget are now registered in
  ``checkbox.zcml``.

- Feature: If a value cannot be converted from its unicode representation to a
  field value using the field's ``IFromUnicode`` interface, the resulting type
  error now shows the field name, if available.

- Bug: ``createId`` could not handle arbitrary unicode input. Thanks to
  Andreas Reuleaux for reporting the bug and a patch for it. (Added
  descriptive doctests for the function in the process.)

- Bug: Interface invariants where not working when not all fields needed for
  computing the invariant are in the submitted form.

- Bug: Ordered select didn't submit selected values.

- Bug: Ordered select lists displayed tokens instead of value,

- Bug: ``SequenceWidget`` displayed tokens instead of value.

1.7.0 (2007-10-09)
------------------

- Feature: Implemented ``ImageButton``, ``ImageAction``, ``ImageWidget``, and
  ``ImageFieldWidget`` to support imge submit buttons.

- Feature: The ``AttributeField`` data manager now supports adapting
  the content to the fields interface when the content doesn't implement
  this interface.

- Feature: Implemented single checkbox widget that can be used for boolean
  fields. They are not available by default but can be set using the
  ``widgetFactory`` attribute.

- Bug: More lingual issues have been fixed in the documentation. Thanks to
  Martijn Faassen for doing this.

- Bug: When an error occurred during processing of the request the
  widget ended up being security proxied and the system started
  throwing `TraversalError`-'s trying to access the `label` attribute of
  the widget. Declared that the widgets require the `zope.Public`
  permission in order to access these attributes.

- Bug: When rendering a widget the ``style`` attribute was not honored. Thanks
  to Andreas Reuleaux for reporting.

- Bug: When an error occurred in the sub-form, the status message was not set
  correctly. Fixed the code and the incorrect test. Thanks to Markus
  Kemmerling for reporting.

- Bug: Several interfaces had the ``self`` argument in the method
  signature. Thanks to Markus Kemmerling for reporting.

  and form.


==========
z3c.formjs
==========

0.4.0 (2008-08-26)
------------------

- Feature: There is now a special unique prefix generator that uses
  `z3c.form`'s new ``createCSSId()`` function to generate css selectable
  prefixes for ajax forms.

- Feature: There is now a viewlet manager already registered with all
  the viewlets necessary to use `z3c.formjs`.  You can now just do:

    &lt;script tal:replace="structure
                         provider:z3c.formjs.interfaces.IDynamicJavaScript"&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;

- Feature: When AJAX handlers return complex data structures (dictionaries,
  lists and tuples), the data is automatically converted into JSON
  format before delivery.

- Restructure: Make package run on latest z3c.form 1.9.0 release.

- Bug: Widgets that were being updated multiple times were generating
  duplicate javascript event subscriptions. This is now fixed.

0.3.0 (2007-10-03)
------------------

- Feature: Made a JavaScript renderer for calls to JS Functions.

- Feature: Implemented tools to make server side events propagate to
  the client.

- Feature: Now the ``jsevent.subscribe`` and ``jsaction.handler`` decorators
  can be chained together, allowing them to be called multiple time for the
  same methods.

- Feature: Implemented ability to switch widget modes on a form.


==============
z3c.formjsdemo
==============

0.3.1 (2008-08-26)
------------------

- Restructure: Made links on index page relative to context so you can do
  better virtual hosting.

- Restructure: Changed dates to ISO-8601 format.

- Feature: Tree Editor demo shows solution to having inline forms
  submitted via ajax and shows off server to client event propagation.

- Feature: Widget Switching demo.  Shows off ajax switching between
  display and input widgets.


==========
z3c.formui
==========

1.4.2 (2008-08-26)
------------------

- Bug: Corrected typos and unwanted unicode characters.

1.4.1 (2008-01-23)
------------------

- Fixed up meta-data and the release.

1.4.0 (2008-01-21)
------------------

- Feature: Added subform content and layout template. This allows you to
  configure real sub forms which do not render the form tag.

- Feature: Improve layout implementation, support built-in layout templates.

- Feature: Use ``IContentTemplate`` instead of ``IPageTemplate`` in layout
  base classes. This will help to prevent running into recursion errors if
  there is a missing layout template.

- Feature: Added form module which offers built-in layout support.

- Bug: Added missing display ``IContentTemplate``, otherwise we can run into a
  recursion in some cases.

- Bug: Renamed table macro argument from ``form-required-info`` to
  ``required-info``. The macro ``form-required-info`` did not exist.

- Bug: Added unit tests for layout support.

- Bug: Added tests for layout macros.

- Bug: Added tests for layout templates.

1.3.0 (2007-08-24)
------------------

- Refactoring: Update CSS classes to reflect latest changes to the widget
  classes in ``z3c.form``.

- Bug: Error view snippets may have a empty ``widget`` attribute values, so we
  cannot rely on accessing the label of the widget. This is the case, if the
  error view sniipet was created from an invariants validation error.

- Bug: The table-form template did not properly render the error at the
  widget, because the ``render()`` method was not called. Thanks to Markus
  Leist for the report.

zc.catalog
==========

1.2.0 (2007-11-03)
------------------

Features added
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Updated package meta-data.

* zc.catalog now can use 64-bit BTrees ("L") as provided by ZODB 3.8.

* Albertas Agejavas (alga@pov.lt) included the new CallableWrapper, for
  when the typical Zope 3 index-by-adapter story
  (zope.app.catalog.attribute) is unnecessary trouble, and you just want
  to use a callable.  See callablewrapper.txt.  This can also be used for
  other indexes based on the zope.index interfaces.

* Extents now have a __len__.  The current implementation defers to the
  standard BTree len implementation, and shares its performance
  characteristics: it needs to wake up all of the buckets, but if all of the
  buckets are awake it is a fairly quick operation.

* A simple ISelfPoulatingExtent was added to the extentcatalog module for
  which populating is a no-op.  This is directly useful for catalogs that
  are used as implementation details of a component, in which objects are
  indexed explicitly by your own calls rather than by the usual subscribers.
  It is also potentially slightly useful as a base for other self-populating
  extents.

==================
zc.resourcelibrary
==================

1.0.1 (2008-03-07)
------------------

Bugs fixed:

- added the behavior from the standard Zope 3 response to guess that a body
  that is not HTML without an explicit mimetype should have a
  'text/plain' mimetype.  This means that, for instance, redirects with
  a body of '' and no explicit content type will no longer cause an
  exception in the resourcelibrary response code.

1.0.0 (2008-02-17)
------------------

New features:

- You can now provide an alternative "directory-resource"
  factory. This facilitates implementation of dynamic resources.


Bugs fixed:

- Updated the functional-testing zcml file to get rid of a deprication
  warning.

0.8.2 (2007-12-07)
------------------

- bug fix: when checking content type, take into account that it may be None

3.5.2 (2008-07-31)
------------------

- Bug: It turned out that checking for regex was not much better of an idea,
  since it causes deprecation warnings in Python 2.4. Thus let's look for a
  library that was added in Python 2.5.

3.5.1 (2008-06-24)
------------------

- Bug: The `gopherlib` module has been deprecated in Python 2.5. Whenever the
  ZCML of this package was included when using Python 2.5, a deprecation
  warning had been raised stating that `gopherlib` has been
  deprecated. Provided a simple condition to check whether Python 2.5 or later
  is installed by checking for the deleted `regex` module and thus optionally
  load the security declaration for `gopherlib`.

3.5.0 (2008-02-05)
------------------

- Feature:
  `zope.app.security.principalregistry.PrincipalRegistry.getPrincipal` returns
  `zope.security.management.system_user` when its id is used for the search
  key.

  wasn't stating that in its dependencies.
