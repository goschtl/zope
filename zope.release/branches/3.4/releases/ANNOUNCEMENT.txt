====================
Zope 3.4.0 Released!
====================

January 29, 2009 - The Zope 3 development team announces the Zope 3.4.0 release.

After 2 years of development, the Zope Foundation and the larger Zope
community is proud to announce the release of Zope 3.4.0.

The focus of the Zope 3.4 development was the conversion from one monolithic
source tree to a set of many small packages (eggs) that can be used
independently of each other. The core further stabalized through lots of bug
fixes and many new add-on packages were developed to provide a richer
development experience.

With this release comes also renewed commitment to a short and reliable
release cycle of 6 months.


Packages and Eggs
-----------------

Zope 3 is now fully converted to an egg-based system. While some work still
remains, it integrates in the best possible way with the rest of the Python
community. The conversion to eggs also enables other Python developers to only
use small bits and pieces of the complete Zope software. The conversion
largely means that Zope 3 developers do not use the classic Zope 3 TAR ball
release anymore. However, for your convenience, the Zope 3 developers will
provide the classic Zope 3 tar ball releases for at least the 3.4 series and
probably for 3.5 as well.

So how are Zope 3 applications built using only eggs?


The Known Good Set (KGS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The known good set -- or in short KGS -- is a configuration of packages and
their versions that are known to work well together. The compatibility is
frequently verified by running over twelve thousand tests on a daily
basis [1]_. The KGS is tested against Python 2.4 and 2.5 on the 32- and 64-bit
platforms. The list of controlled packages and their versions for Zope 3.4 can
be found at the Zope 3 KGS site [2]_.

The KGS can be used in several ways [3]_. The most common way is to "nail" the
versions by downloading the version configuration file [4]_ and insert them as
follows in your buildout configuration::

  [buildout]
  versions = versions
  ...

  [versions]
  zope.interface = 3.4.0
  ...


``zopeproject`` Project Builder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start building a project using a common setup, a package called
`zopeproject` can be used to quickly setup the boilerplate for the
project. Ample documentation is provided at the `zopeproject` home page
[5]_. `zopeproject` uses Paste or ZDaemon to create a working server. The
following commands get you started::

  $ easy_install zopeproject
  $ zopeproject HelloWorld
  $ cd HelloWorld
  $ bin/helloworld-ctl foreground


Demo Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point, there is no demo package demonstrating a simple Zope 3
application setup. However, the ``z3c.formdemo`` package can be used as a
fairly minimal setup. To get started with it, enter the following::

  $ svn co svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/z3c.formdemo/tags/1.5.3 formdemo
  $ cd formdemo
  $ python bootstrap.py
  $ ./bin/buildout -v
  $ ./bin/demo fg

About Zope 3
------------

Zope 3 is a web application server that continues to build on the heritage of
Zope. It was rewritten from scratch based on the latest software design
patterns and the experiences of Zope 2.

The component architecture is the very core of Zope 3 that allows developers to
create flexible and powerful web applications.


Compatibility with Zope 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Zope 3 is not upwards compatible with Zope 2. This means you cannot run Zope 2
applications in Zope 3.

We continue to work on the transition from Zope 2 to Zope 3 by making Zope 2
use more and more of the Zope 3 infrastructure. This means that new code
written in Zope 2 can benefit from Zope 3 technology. Also, with care, code
can be written that works in both Zope 3 and Zope 2.  This allows a Zope 2
application to slowly evolve towards Zope 3.  Unchanged Zope 2 applications
are never expected to work in Zope 3, however.


About the Zope Foundation
-------------------------

The Zope Foundation, based in Fredricksburg, Virginia, is a not-for-profit
organisation that provides support for the Zope community and the Zope
platform and its associated software. Its community includes the open source
community of contributers as well as the community of businesses and
organizations that use Zope.
