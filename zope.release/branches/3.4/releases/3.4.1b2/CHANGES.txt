RestrictedPython
================

3.5.1 (2009-03-17)
------------------

- Added tests for ``Utilities`` module.

- Filtered DeprecationWarnings when importing Python's ``sets`` module.

3.5.0 (2009-02-09)
------------------

- Dropped legacy support for Python 2.1 / 2.2 (``__future__`` imports
  of ``nested_scopes`` / ``generators``.).

3.4.3 (2008-10-26)
------------------

- Fixed deprecation warning: ``with`` is now a reserved keyword on
  Python 2.6. That means RestrictedPython should run on Python 2.6
  now. Thanks to Ranjith Kannikara, GSoC Student for the patch.

- Added tests for ternary if expression and for 'with' keyword and
  context managers.

3.4.2 (2007-07-28)

1.3.6 (2007-10-29)
------------------

Bugs fixed

* Backported decref crash fix from 2.0

* Well hidden free-while-in-use crash bug in ObjectPath

Other changes

* The test suites now run ``gc.collect()`` in the ``tearDown()``
  methods.  While this makes them take a lot longer to run, it also
  makes it easier to link a specific test to garbage collection
  problems that would otherwise appear in later tests.

z3c.coverage
============

1.1.3 (2009-07-24)
------------------

- Bug: Doctest did not normalize the whitespace in `coveragediff.txt`. For
  some reason it passes while testing independently, but when running all
  tests, it failed.

1.1.2 (2008-04-14)
------------------

- Bug: When a package path contained anywhere the word "test", it was ignored
  from the coverage report. The intended behavior, however, was to ignore
  files that relate to setting up tests.

- Bug: Sort the results of `os.listdir()` in `README.txt` to avoid
  non-deterministic failures.

- Bug: The logic for ignoring unit and functional test modules also used to
  ignore modules and packages called `testing`.

- Change "Unit test coverage" to "Test coverage" in the title -- it works
  perfectly fine for functional tests too.

------------------

========
z3c.form
========

1.9.0 (2008-08-26)
------------------

- Feature: Use the ``query()`` method in the widget manager to try extract a
  value. This ensures that the lookup is never failing, which is particularly
  helpful for dictionary-based data managers, where dictionaries might not
  have all keys.

- Feature: Changed the ``get()`` method of the data manager to throw an error
  when the data for the field cannot be found. Added ``query()`` method to
  data manager that returns a default value, if no value can be found.

- Feature: Deletion of widgets from field widget managers is now possible.

- Feature: Groups now produce detailed `ObjectModifiedEvent` descriptions like
  regular edit forms do. (Thanks to Carsten Senger for providing a patch.)

- Feature: The widget manager's ``extract()`` method now supports an optional
  ``setErrors`` (default value: True) flag that allows one to not set errors
  on the widgets and widget manager during data extraction. Use case: You want
  to inspect the entered data and handle errors manually.

- Bug: The ``ignoreButtons`` flag of the ``z3c.form.form.extends()`` method
  was not honored. (Thanks to Carsten Senger for providing a patch.)

- Bug: Group classes now implement ``IGroup``. This also helps with the
  detection of group instantiation. (Thanks to Carsten Senger for providing a
  patch.)

- Bug: The list of changes in a group were updated incorrectly, since it was
  assumed that groups would modify mutually exclusive interfaces. Instead of
  using an overwriting dictionary ``update()`` method, a purely additive merge
  is used now. (Thanks to Carsten Senger for providing a patch.)

- Bug: Added a widget for ``IDecimal`` field in testing setup.

- Feature: The ``z3c.form.util`` module has a new function, ``createCSSId()``
  method that generates readable ids for use with css selectors from any
  unicode string.

- Bug: The ``applyChanges()`` method in group forms did not return a changes
  dictionary, but simply a boolean. This is now fixed and the group form
  changes are now merged with the main form changes.

- Bug: Display widgets did not set the style attribute if it was
  available, even though the input widgets did set the style attribute.


============
z3c.formdemo
============

1.5.6 (2010-04-28)
------------------

- 1.5.5 tar.gz was broken

1.5.5 (2010-04-28)
------------------

- 1.5.4 tar.gz was broken

1.5.4 (2010-04-27)
------------------

- fixed security declarations for z3c.layer >= 0.2.4

1.5.3 (2008-08-26)
------------------

- Refactoring: make links relative so it will work better with virtual
  hosting.


==========
z3c.formjs
==========

0.4.0 (2008-08-26)
------------------

- Feature: There is now a special unique prefix generator that uses
  `z3c.form`'s new ``createCSSId()`` function to generate css selectable
  prefixes for ajax forms.

- Feature: There is now a viewlet manager already registered with all
  the viewlets necessary to use `z3c.formjs`.  You can now just do:

    &lt;script tal:replace="structure
                         provider:z3c.formjs.interfaces.IDynamicJavaScript"&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;

- Feature: When AJAX handlers return complex data structures (dictionaries,
  lists and tuples), the data is automatically converted into JSON
  format before delivery.

- Restructure: Make package run on latest z3c.form 1.9.0 release.

- Bug: Widgets that were being updated multiple times were generating
  duplicate javascript event subscriptions. This is now fixed.


==============
z3c.formjsdemo
==============

0.3.1 (2008-08-26)
------------------

- Restructure: Made links on index page relative to context so you can do
  better virtual hosting.

- Restructure: Changed dates to ISO-8601 format.

- Restructure: Removed deprecations warnings for ``ISession`` and
  ``ZopeSecurityPlicy``.


==========

==========

1.4.2 (2008-08-26)
------------------

========
z3c.i18n
========

0.1.1 (2007-11-01)
------------------

- Improve package meta-data.


=========
z3c.layer
=========

0.2.4 (2010-04-18)
------------------

- **Security issue:** The traversers defined for
  ``IPageletBrowserLayer`` and ``IMinimalBrowserLayer`` was trusted adapters, so the security
  proxy got removed from each traversed object. Thus all sub-objects
  were publically accessable, too.

  Making this change might BREAK your application!
  That means if security is not well declared.

- Bugfix: use IContentTemplate instead of IPageTemplate which avoids to get the
  layout template if no IPageTemplate is registered

0.2.3 (2007-11-07)
------------------

- Forward-Bug: Due to a bug in mechanize, the testbrowser throws
  ``httperror_seek_wrapper`` instead of ``HTTPError`` errors. Thanks to RE
  normalizers, the code will now work whether the bug is fixed or not in
  mechanize.

==========
zc.catalog
==========

1.2.0 (2007-11-03)
------------------

Features added
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Updated package meta-data.

* zc.catalog now can use 64-bit BTrees ("L") as provided by ZODB 3.8.

* Albertas Agejavas (alga@pov.lt) included the new CallableWrapper, for
  when the typical Zope 3 index-by-adapter story
  (zope.app.catalog.attribute) is unnecessary trouble, and you just want
  to use a callable.  See callablewrapper.txt.  This can also be used for
  other indexes based on the zope.index interfaces.

* Extents now have a __len__.  The current implementation defers to the
  standard BTree len implementation, and shares its performance
  characteristics: it needs to wake up all of the buckets, but if all of the
  buckets are awake it is a fairly quick operation.

* A simple ISelfPoulatingExtent was added to the extentcatalog module for
  which populating is a no-op.  This is directly useful for catalogs that
  are used as implementation details of a component, in which objects are
  indexed explicitly by your own calls rather than by the usual subscribers.
  It is also potentially slightly useful as a base for other self-populating
  extents.

- Improve package data.

- Developed proper package dependencies.

------------------

- unpin requirement, 'zope.testing<=3.4.9999' that collides with the
  KGS 3.4.0 and 3.4.1

1.0.4 (2010-05-05)
------------------

- fix tests for distribute and python stdlib

1.0.3 (2008-09-10)

==================
zc.resourcelibrary
==================

1.0.1 (2008-03-07)
------------------

Bugs fixed:

- added the behavior from the standard Zope 3 response to guess that a body
  that is not HTML without an explicit mimetype should have a
  'text/plain' mimetype.  This means that, for instance, redirects with
  a body of '' and no explicit content type will no longer cause an
  exception in the resourcelibrary response code.


================
zc.sourcefactory
================

0.3.5 (2008-12-08)
------------------

- Fixed bug in __new__ of contexual factories that would disallow

=======

2.0.4 (2009-04-20)
------------------

- Version 2.0.3 broke support for relative paths to the socket (``-s``
  option and ``socket-name`` parameter), now relative paths work again

- Fixed author's email address.

- Removed zpkg stuff.

2.0.3 (2009-04-11)
------------------

- Added support to bootstrap on Jython.

- If the run directory does not exist it will be created. This allow to use
  `/var/run/mydaemon` as run directory when /var/run is a tmpfs (LP #318118).

Bugs Fixed

- No longer uses a hardcoded filename (/tmp/demo.zdsock) in unit tests.
  This lets you run the tests on Python 2.4 and 2.5 simultaneously without
  spurious errors.

- make -h work again for both runner and control scripts.
  Help is now taken from the __doc__ of the options class users by
  the zdaemon script being run.

3.4.1 (2008-08-26)
------------------

- Annotation factories take care not to store proxies in the database,
  so adapting an object wrapped in a ``LocationProxy`` works correctly.

zope.app.zapi
=============

3.4.0 (2007-10-03)
------------------

Initial public release as an individual package.

Zope Application Programming Interface

This package provides a collection of commonly used APIs to make
imports simpler.

Mostly, the APIs provided here are imported from elsewhere. A few are
provided here.

principals()

The principals method returns the authentication service. If no
service is defined, a ComponentLookupError is raised:

  >>> from zope.app import zapi
  >>> zapi.principals() #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  ComponentLookupError:
  (<InterfaceClass zope.app.security.interfaces.IAuthentication>, '')


But if we provide an authentication service:

  >>> import zope.interface
  >>> from zope.app.security.interfaces import IAuthentication
  >>> class FakeAuthenticationUtility:
  ...     zope.interface.implements(IAuthentication)
  >>> fake = FakeAuthenticationUtility()

  >>> from zope.app.testing import ztapi
  >>> ztapi.provideUtility(IAuthentication, fake)

Then we should be able to get the service back when we ask for the
principals:

  >>> zapi.principals() is fake
  True

3.4.9 (2009-07-13)
------------------

* Backport fix LP #332061 from trunk (rev 101967): publisher emitted

Added BeforeObjectAssignedEvent that is triggered before the object
field sets a value.


=============
zope.security
=============

3.4.3 (unknown)
---------------

- Backported a fix made by Gary Poster to the 3.4 branch:
  Fix for LP bug 181833 (from Gustavo Niemeyer). Before "visiting" a
  sub-object, a check should be made to ensure the object is still valid.
  Because garbage collection may involve loops, if you garbage collect an
  object, it is possible that the actions done on this object may modify the
  state of other objects. This may cause another round of garbage collection,
  eventually generating a segfault (see LP bug). The Py_VISIT macro does the
  necessary checks, so it is used instead of the previous code.

3.4.2 (unknown)
---------------

- Added dependency 'zope.thread' to setup.py, without the tests were
  failing.

- Backported a fix made by Albertas Agejevas to the 3.4 branch. He
  fixed a bug in DecoratedSecurityCheckerDescriptor which made
  security-wrapping location proxied exception instances throw
  exceptions on Python 2.5.  See
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/251848

3.4.1 (unknown)
---------------

===================
zope.securitypolicy
===================

3.4.4 (2010-04-29)
------------------

- LP #564525: Revert the name used for the view permission exported by
  ``zope.dublincore`` to one which matches the names in released versions
  of that package (3.6.0 and earlier).

3.4.3 (2010-04-16)
------------------

- LP #564525:  fix permission moved from ``zope.app.dublincore`` namespace
  to ``zope.dublincore``, and make its grant conditional on the presence of
  ``zope.dublincore``.

3.4.2 (2009-01-28)
------------------

- Changed mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org. Fix package
  homepage to the pypi page.

- Fix test in buildout which still depended on zope.app.securitypolicy
  by mistake.

- Remove explicit dependency on zope.app.form from ``setup.py``; nothing
  in the code directly depends on this.

3.4.1 (2008-06-02)
------------------

- Fix reference to deprecated security policy from ZCML.


=============
zope.sendmail
=============

3.5.1 (2009-01-26)
------------------

- Copied over the UtilityTerm and UtilityVocabulary implementation from
  zope.app.component to avoid a dependency.

- Work around a problem when smtp quit fails, the mail was considered not
  delivered where just the quit failed.

3.5.0 (2008-07-05)
------------------

- final release (identical with 3.5.0b2)

3.5.0b2 (2007-12-19)
--------------------

- If the SMTP server rejects a message (for example, when the sender or
  recipient address is malformed), that email stays in the queue forever
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/157104).

3.5.0b1 (2007-11-08)
--------------------

- Added README.txt
- Can now talk to servers that don't implement EHLO
- Fix bug that caused files with very long names to be created
- Fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/157104: move aside mail that's
  causing 5xx server responses.

3.5.0a2 (2007-10-23)
--------------------

- Cleaned up ``does_esmtp`` in faux SMTP connection classes provided by the
  tests.
- If the ``QueueProcessorThread`` is asked to stop while sending messages, do
  so after sending the current message; previously if there were many, many
  messages to send, the thread could stick around for quite a while.

3.5.0a1 (2007-10-23)
--------------------

- ``QueueProcessorThread`` now accepts an optional parameter *interval* for
  defining how often to process the mail queue (default is 3 seconds)

- Several ``QueueProcessorThreads`` (either in the same process, or multiple
  processes) can now deliver messages from a single maildir without duplicates
  being sent.

3.4.0 (2007-08-20)
------------------

- Bugfix: Don't keep open files around for every email message
  to be sent on transaction commit.  People who try to send many emails
  in a single transaction now will not run out of file descriptors.

========
zope.tal
========

3.4.1 (2007-11-16)
------------------

- Removed unnecessary ``dummyengine`` dependency on zope.i18n to
  simplify distribution.  The ``dummyengine.DummyTranslationDomain``
  class no longer implements
  ``zope.i18n.interfaces.ITranslationDomain`` as a result.  Installing
  zope.tal with easy_install or buildout no longer pulls in many
  unrelated distributions.

- Support ability to run tests using "setup.py test".

- Stop pinning (no longer required) zope.traversing and
  zope.app.publisher versions in buildout.cfg.
