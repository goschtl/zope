To Do
=====

 * figure out why SQLAlchemy complains when two projects try adding the same 
   table names in different databases (hint: it is probabaly because ZAlchemy 
   uses the global_connection to pass around the table object to be bound to an 
   engine, but doesn't seem to ever clean up the tables after it is done).
   
 * add tests to the demos

 * copy/paste of fragments between messages (in demo_4) ends up doing a
   cut/paste instead, and a cut/paste ends up doing a deletion. This is probably
   because of the current FK relationships.
   
 * add more descriptive comments in the code.
