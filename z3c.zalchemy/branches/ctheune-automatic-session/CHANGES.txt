0.2 - unreleased
================

  - Provide a tighter integration with Zope's transaction mechanism. Sessions
    are now automatically associated with new objects. We rely on SQLAlchemy's
    SessionContext object which hands out a session for each thread. Your code
    rarely should never have to call `session.save(object)` now.

0.1.1 - 2007-06-27
==================

  - Fixed a failing test in TRANSACTION.txt where an exception demonstrated a
    string being returned but it was a unicode string.


0.1 - never released
====================

  - This was supposed to be the first release, but we missed a broken test.
    See 0.1.1
