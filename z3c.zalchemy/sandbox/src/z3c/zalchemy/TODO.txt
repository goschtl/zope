- test rollback behaviour

- better README !!!
   Show the problems with newely created objects.

- data manager
   It is not fully clear what should be done in commit and what should be done
   in tpc_vote !

- where to create a table for a fresh database
   Remove the hack in datamanager.beforeTraversal

- container implementation is some kind of a quick hack

- sqlalchemy's proxy handling is not using a global connection pool !
   Each proxy creates a new engine even if it is the same database.

       Solved by using the database utility to create the engine and directly
       assign this engine to all proxies.
       Shotcuts ProxyEngines's connect !?

- use of ActiveMapper

- Adapter for sqlalchemy mapped object deletion
