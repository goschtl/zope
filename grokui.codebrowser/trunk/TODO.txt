TODO
====

Short term
----------

* Fintune output using own views for packages, modules, etc.

* Find more root packages.

* Add displaying of source code


Long term
---------

* Passive scanning of code?

  Right now all packages and components scanned are actively loaded
  before being examined. This can have unwanted
  side-effects. Furthermore the used scanner (from martian) is not
  able to handle all packages available. Find out what's going on
  there and fix it by providing an own scanner or improving martian
  scanner.
