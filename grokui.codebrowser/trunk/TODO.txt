TODO
====

Short term
----------

* Fintune output using own views for packages, modules, etc.

* Find more root packages.

Long term
---------

* Passive scanning of code?

  Right now all packages and components scanned are actively loaded
  before being examined. This can have unwanted
  side-effects. Furthermore the used scanner (from martian) is not
  able to handle all packages available.
