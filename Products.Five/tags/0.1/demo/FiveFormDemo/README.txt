This is a *very* basic example for zop3 schemas + widgets.
Just copy to Products and run. 

This demo needs FiveViewsDemo for now and extends it in
providing another view on folgers, "simpleform.html" which
displays some form fields.

When submitted, the form checks the input and returns it.
