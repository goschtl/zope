How to install Five
-------------------

Requirements for Five 1.0
=========================

* Zope 2.7.4+ with python 2.3.x. Zope versions lower than Zope 2.7.4
  may work, but no guarantees.

* Zope X3.0.0, found here: http://zope.org/Products/ZopeX3/3.0.0final/

Note that Five 1.0 is also part of Zope 2.8, so if you are using Zope
2.8, you do not need to install Five separately, unless you want to
use a version of Five later than 1.0.

Installing Five
===============

Installing Five is relatively straightforward. 

* Select a Zope 2.7 instance.

* Download and install Zope X3.0.0. You can get it compiled and
  installed by:

    * Typing ``configure``. When you're experimenting, typically you
      want to use the ``--prefix`` directive to install the binaries
      to install it somewhere in your homedirectory.

    * ``make``
  
    * ``make install``

  On windows you can install choose to use the binary release instead.

  Alternatively you can check out the latest subversion version of
  Zope X3.0 and typing ``make`` to produce it in-place.

* You need to make your Zope 2.7 instance aware of Zope 3 so it can
  import the ``zope``, ``persistent`` and ``transaction`` packages from it.

* In non-ZEO setups, you can simply go to the ``etc/zope.conf`` of
  your Zope 2.7 instance and add a ``path`` entry. If you used the
  released version of Zope X3.0.0, use something like the following::

    path /path/to/installed/Zope3/lib/python

  If you are instead using the subversion version, use::

    path /path/to/Zope3/src

  If you have problems however, see the instructions for the ZEO
  setup.

* In ZEO setups (or some other circumstances), Zope 3's ZEO packages
  will interfere with Zope 2's. In this case you can create a new
  directory, symlink the ``zope``, ``persistent`` and ``transaction``
  packages in it and use this directory for the ``path`` entry in the
  ``etc/zope.conf`` of your Zope 2.7 instance.

* Next, install the Five product into your Zope 2.7 instance as a
  product and restart Zope. Five should now be installed.

* You can also install various products in the ``doc/products``
  subdirectory of Five by copying them into your ``Products``
  directory.
