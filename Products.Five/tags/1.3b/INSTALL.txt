How to install Five
-------------------

Requirements for Five 1.3
=========================

* Zope 2.9+ with Python 2.4.1+

Note that Five 1.3 is already part of Zope 2.9.  You can still install
a newer Five version in your instance, if you like.  It will override
the Five product inside the Zope tree.

Running the tests
=================

For information on how to install the automatic Five tests, please see
``tests/README.txt``.
