How to install Five
===================

Requirements for Five 1.0.3
---------------------------

* Zope 2.8.0+ with Python 2.3.x.

Note that Five 1.0 is also part of Zope 2.8.  You can still install a
newer Five version in your instance, if you like.  It will override
the Five product inside the Zope tree.


Running the tests
-----------------

For information on how to install the automatic Five tests, please see
``tests/README.txt``.
