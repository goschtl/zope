Version 1.3.0 (6/??/2007)
-------------------------

- Documentation: Integrated English language and content review improvements
  by Roy Mathew in ``form.txt``.

- Feature: The ``IFields`` class' ``select()`` and ``omit()`` method now
  support two ketword arguments "prefix" and "interface" that allow the
  selection and omission of prefixed fields and still specify the short
  name. Thanks to Nikolay Kim for the idea.

- Feature: HTML element ids containing dots are not very good, because
  then the "element#id" CSS selector does not work and at least in
  Firefox the attribute selector ("element[attr=value]") does not work
  for the id either. Converted the codebase to use dashes in ids instead.

- Bug/Feature: The IWidgets component is now an adapter of the form
  content and not the form context. This guarantees that vocabulary
  factories receive a context that is actually useful.

- Bug: The readonly flag within a field was never honored. When a field is
  readonly, it is displayed in "display" mode now. This can be overridden by
  the widget manager's "ignoreReadonly" flag, which is necessary for add
  forms.

- Bug: The mode selection made during the field layout creation
  was not honored and the widget manager always overrode the
  options providing its value. Now the mode specified in the
  field is more important than the one from the widget manager.

- Bug: It sometimes happens that the sequence widget has the
  no-value token as one element. This caused ``displayValue()`` to
  fail, since it tried to find a term for it. For now we simply
  ignore the no-value token.

- Bug: Fixed the converter when the incoming value is an
  empty string. An empty string really means that we have no value
  and it is thus missing, returning the missing value.

- Bug: Fix a slightly incorrect implementation. It did not cause any harm in
  real-world forms, but made unit testing much harder, since an API
  expectation was not met correctly.

- Bug: When required selections where not selected in radio and checkbox
  widgets, then the conversion did not behave correctly. This also
  revealed some issues with the converter code that have been fixed now.

- Bug: When fields only had a vocabulary name, the choice terms adaptation
  would fail, since the field was not bound. This has now been corrected.
