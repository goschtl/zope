Framework
---------

- When an attribute is not accessible, provide a nice error message.


Documentation
-------------


Samples
-------

Write some samples to show the power of the new widget and form framework.

- Object name as an additional field in an add form

- Complex CRUD

  * sub-forms

  * custom widgets (date)

  * one widget manipulates multiple fields

  * Non-ZODB storage


Improvements
------------

Add explicit difference between error and confirmation message e.g.
"There were some errors." and "No changes were applied."


Notes from Roger
----------------

- Define all widget attributes for the different widgets in the interfaces 
  as fields
