CHANGES
=======

- Added support for ``hidden`` fields. You can now use the ``hidden`` mode
  for widgets which should get rendered as <input type="hidden" />. Note;
  There is only a hidden widget template registered for ITextWidget. We have to
  define more hidden widgets for sequence etc. Also make sure you use the new 
  formui templates which will avoid rendering labels for hidden widgets or
  adjust your custom form macros.

- Added missing_value support to data/time converters

- Changed registration of file upload data converter. Register 
  FileUploadDataConverter for IBytes/IFileWidget. This will force to use the 
  data converter only for IFileWidget and not for IBytes at all. IBytes/IWidget
  uses by default the FieldDataConverter.

  What does this mean:
  If you need to use a text area widget for IBytes, you have to register a 
  custom widget in the form because the default widget for IBytes is a file 
  upload widget. You can do this by simply set:

  ``fields['foobar'].widgetFactory = TextWidget``

- Fix extractFileName method, now it doesn't remove dots from a filename
  Added a couple tests for extractFileName

- Added named vocabulary lookup in ChoiceTerms and CollectionTerms

- Implemented support for FileUpload in FileWidget

- Added helper for handling FileUpload. You can find this helpers in 
  z3c.form.util:
  
  def extractContentType(form, id):
      """Knows how to extract a filename if a IBytes/IFileWidget was used."""

  def extractFileName(form, id, cleanup=True):
      """Knows how to extract a filename if a IBytes/IFileWidget was used.

      Uploads from win/IE need some cleanup because the filename includes also 
      the path. cleanUp=True will do this for you.
      """
