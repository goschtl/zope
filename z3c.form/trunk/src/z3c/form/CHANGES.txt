- Added missing_value support to data/time converters

- Changed registration of file upload data converter. Register 
  FileUploadDataConverter for IBytes/IFileWidget. This will force to use the 
  data converter only for IFileWidget and not for IBytes at all. IBytes/IWidget
  uses by default the FieldDataConverter.

  What does this mean:
  If you need to use a text area widget for IBytes, you have to register a 
  custom widget in the form because the default widget for IBytes is a file 
  upload widget. You can do this by simply set:

  ``fields['foobar'].widgetFactory = TextWidget``

- Fix extractFileName method, now it doesn't remove dots from a filename
  Added a couple tests for extractFileName

- Added named vocabulary lookup in ChoiceTerms and CollectionTerms

- Implemented support for FileUpload in FileWidget

- Added helper for handling FileUpload. You can find this helpers in 
  z3c.form.util:
  
  def extractContentType(form, id):
      """Knows how to extract a filename if a IBytes/IFileWidget was used."""

  def extractFileName(form, id, cleanup=True):
      """Knows how to extract a filename if a IBytes/IFileWidget was used.

      Uploads from win/IE need some cleanup because the filename includes also 
      the path. cleanUp=True will do this for you.
      """
