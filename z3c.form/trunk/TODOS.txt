Framework
---------

- There is only hidden widget templates registered for ``ITextWidget``
  and ``ISelectWidget``. We have to define more hidden widgets.


Widgets
-------

- The MultiWidget should render a minimum number of elements by default
  if the field defines min_length. Also, if user tries to remove elements
  so the number of widgets becomes less than minimum - the widget should
  add widgets to make their number minimum again. (Did you understand
  this?:))

- The MultiWidget should provide a way to reorder elements if used
  for the ISequence field.

Documentation

Samples
-------

Write some samples to show the power of the new widget and form framework.

- Object name as an additional field in an add form


Improvements
------------

Add explicit difference between error and confirmation message e.g.
"There were some errors." and "No changes were applied."
