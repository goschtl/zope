Version 1.3.0 (5/31/2007)
-------------------------

- Documentation: Integrated English language and content review improvements
  by Roy Mathew in ``form.txt``.

- Feature: The ``IFields`` class' ``select()`` and ``omit()`` method now
  support two ketword arguments "prefix" and "interface" that allow the
  selection and omission of prefixed fields and still specify the short
  name. Thanks to Nikolay Kim for the idea.

- Bug: When fields only had a vocabulary name, the choice terms adaptation
  would fail, since the field was not bound. This has now been corrected.

Version 1.2.0 (5/30/2007)
-------------------------

- Feature: Added ability to change the button action title using an IValue
  adapter.
