Version 1.3.0 (6/??/2007)
-------------------------

- Documentation: Integrated English language and content review improvements
  by Roy Mathew in ``form.txt``.

- Feature: The ``IFields`` class' ``select()`` and ``omit()`` method now
  support two ketword arguments "prefix" and "interface" that allow the
  selection and omission of prefixed fields and still specify the short
  name. Thanks to Nikolay Kim for the idea.

- Bug: When required selections where not selected in radio and checkbox 
  widgets, then the conversion did not behave correctly. This also 
  revealed some issues with the converter code that have been fixed now.

- Bug: When fields only had a vocabulary name, the choice terms adaptation
  would fail, since the field was not bound. This has now been corrected.

Version 1.2.0 (5/30/2007)
-------------------------

- Feature: Added ability to change the button action title using an IValue
  adapter.
