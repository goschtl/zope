    We've finished creating your project and it is ready to download.
  </p>
<div id="buildit-wrapper">
  <a id="buildit"

  Alternatively, you can just download the xml project definition for
  use on the command line here:
  <a tal:attributes="href string:${context/@@absolute_url}/project.xml"
     tal:content="string:${context/name}.xml">myproject.xml</a>
</p>

  We've also taken the liberty to gather some documentation about
  what to do next with your project which you can read below.  This
  information can also be found in the ZBOILER.txt file in your
  project directory.
