  What's implemented:

    - IPrincipalSource's methods and ILoginPasswordPrincipalSource's
      methods.
    
    - as I said earlier it will play nicely with the pluggableauth
      service only if some class in this service are patched (namely the
      SimplePrincipal class, and IBTreePrincipalSourceContained class).

      This is quite a problem, should I re-implement a SimpleUser
      (that's ugly) or should I change the one there is actually (but
      then the ldapsource is viewed as a container (why not)).

  What's missing :

    - The method to use the source as a container (but I still don't
      know if this is a good way to view the ldapsource).

    - Adding, deleting, modifying a user

    - Caching the users

    - An adapter to provide the information contained in the ldap server

    - SSL support (should be easy I thinka : just use ldaps instead of
      ldap in the connection string).

    - A more decent way to add the principalsource, for now you must add
      it then edit it.

    - Add LDAP server configuration sample for to run tests and
      describe how to setup a test environment.

    - Add links to availabel LDAP servers for linux and windows

    - Add a documentation for to use ldapauth with ms active directory

    - Check the INSTALLATION.txt if it's consitent.

    - Clean up the README.txt, INSTALLATION.txt

    - Add more onlinehelp text in ./help/ldapauth.stx

    - correct license header?
