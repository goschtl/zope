Introduction
------------

In web application construction there are two main ways to publish
objects to the web: routing and traversal. Both are a form of URL
dispatch: in the end, a function or method is called as the result of
the pattern of the URL. Both use very different methods to do so,
however.

In *routing* a mapping is made from URL patterns to controllers (or
views). The URL pattern is used to pull information from the URLs used
and this information is used to determine which particular callable to
call in the end.

Take for instance the URL ``departments/10/employees/17``. A URL
pattern could declare that the arguments `10`` and ``17`` should be
taken from this URL by the system. This information is then used by
the controller to retrieve the correct models from the database. The
controller then uses information in these models to contruct the
content of the view, for instance by rendering it with a HTML
template.

In *traversal*, there is no explicit mapping of URLs to controller or
views. Instead models are traversed step by step, guided by the URL.
By analogy one can in Python traverse through nested dictionaries
(``d['a']['b']['c']``), or attributes (``d.a.b.c``). In the end, a
*view* is looked up for the final model that can be called. The view
could be a special attribute on the model, or more sophisticated
systems can be used separating the view from the model.

The URL ``departments/10/employees/17`` would be resolved to a
callable because there is a ``departments`` container model that
contains ``department`` model objects.  In turn from a ``department``
model one can traverse to the ``employees`` container, which in turn
allows traversal to individual employees, such as employee 17. In the
end a view is looked up for employee 17, and called.

Routing is often used in combination with relational databases
(exposed by means of an object relational mapper,
typically). Traversal is often more convenient with in-memory object
structures or object databases.

Routing has advantages:

* good way for exposing relational content that doesn't have natural
  nesting.

* explicit overview of the URL patterns in an application.

* familiar as used by many frameworks.

Traversal has advantages as well:

* good way for exposing object content that has arbitrary nesting.

* model-driven: objects come equipped with their views, which allows
  for easier composition of application from models.

* location-aware: a nested object structure can be location
  aware. Each model can know about its parent and its name in the
  URL. This allows for easy construction of URLs for arbitrary models.
  In addition, security can be declared on higher levels of the
  structure.

Traject tries to combine the properties of routing and traversal in a
single system. Traject:

* looks like a routing system and has the familiarity of the routing
  approach.

* works well for exposing relational models.

* lets the developer explicitly declare URL mappings.

* supports arbitrary nesting.

* is model-driven. Routing is to models, not to views or controllers.

* is location-aware. Models are in a nested structure and are aware of
  their parent and name, allowing model-based security declarations
  and easy URL construction for models.

Some potential drawbacks of Traject are::

* Traject expects a certain regularity in its patterns. It doesn't
  allow certain complex URL patterns where several variables are part
  of a single step (i.e ``foo/<bar_id>-<baz_id``). Only a single
  variable is allowed per URL segment.

* Traject needs to constructs or retrieve models for *each stage* in
  the route in order to construct a nested structure. This can mean
  more queries to the database per request. In practice this is often
  mitigated by the fact that the parent models in the structure are
  frequently needed by the view logic anyway.

* In Traject each model instance should have one and only one location
  in the URL structure. This allows not only URLs to be resolved to
  models, but also URLs to be generated for models. If you want the
  same model to be accessible through multiple URLs, you might have
  some difficulty.

URL patterns
------------

Let's consider an URL pattern string that is a series of steps
separated by slashes::

  >>> pattern_str = 'foo/bar/baz'

We can decompose it into its component steps using the ``parse``
function::

  >>> import traject
  >>> traject.parse(pattern_str)
  ('foo', 'bar', 'baz')

Steps may also be variables. A variable is a step that is prefixed by
the colon (``:``)::

  >>> traject.parse('foo/:a/baz')
  ('foo', ':a', 'baz')

More than one variable step is allowed in a pattern::

  >>> traject.parse('foo/:a/baz/:b')
  ('foo', ':a', 'baz', ':b')

Each variable in a pattern needs to have a different name, however::

  >>> traject.parse('foo/:a/baz/:a')
  Traceback (innermost last):
    ...
  ParseError: URL pattern contains multiple variables with name: a

Registering patterns
--------------------

In Traject, the resolution of a URL path results in a model. This
model can then in turn have views registered for it that allow this
model to be displayed. How this works is up to the web framework's
view system.

How does Traject know which model to return for a path? You can
register a factory function for a URL pattern. This factory function
should create or retrieve the model object.

The factory function receives parameters for each of the matched
variables in whichever pattern matched - the signature of the factory
function should account for all the variables in the patterns that are
matched.

Let's look at an example.

This is the URL pattern we want to recognize::

  >>> pattern_str = u'departments/:department_id/employees/:employee_id'

We can see two parameters in this URL pattern: `department_id`` and
``customer_id``.

We now define a model object as it might be stored in a database::

  >>> class Employee(object):
  ...   def __init__(self, department_id, employee_id):
  ...     self.department_id = department_id
  ...     self.employee_id = employee_id
  ...   def __repr__(self):
  ...     return '<Employee %s %s>' % (self.department_id, self.employee_id)

Now we define the factory function for this URL pattern. The
parameters in this case would be ``department_id`` and
``employee_id``::

  >>> def factory(department_id, employee_id): 
  ...   return Employee(department_id, employee_id)

The factory function in this case just creates a ``Employee`` object
on the fly. Instead, it could do a database query based on its parents
and the parameters supplied.

In order to register this factory function, we need a registry of patterns, so
we'll create one::

  >>> patterns = traject.Patterns()

A pattern needs to be registered for a class or an interface. In this
case we'll register the patterns for a class ``Root``::

  >>> class Root(object):
  ...    pass

We can now register the URL pattern and the factory::

  >>> patterns.register(Root, pattern_str, factory)

Resolving a path
----------------

Now we are ready to resolve paths. A path is part of a URL such as
``foo/bar/baz``. It looks very much like a pattern, but all the
variables will have been filled in.

The models retrieved by resolving paths will be *located*. Ultimately
their ancestor will be a particular root model from which all paths
are resolved. Let's create one here for demonstration purposes::

  >>> root = Root()

When a path is resolved, a complete chain of ancestors from model to
root is also created. It may be that no particular factory function
was registered for a particular path. In our current registry such
patterns indeed exist: ``departments``, ``departments/:department_id``
and ``departments/:department_id/employees`` all have no factory
registered.

When resolving the pattern we need to supply a special default factory
which will generate an object in such cases. Let's make one here. The
factory function needs to be able to deal with arbitrary keyword
arguments as any number of parameters might be supplied::

  >>> class Default(object):
  ...     def __init__(self, **kw):
  ...         pass

We can now resolve a path::
  
  >>> obj = patterns.resolve(root, u'departments/1/employees/2', Default)
  >>> obj
  <Employee 1 2>

We can also resolve a stack of names (where the first name to resolve
is on the top of the stack)::

  >>> l = [u'departments', u'1', u'employees', u'2']
  >>> l.reverse()
  >>> patterns.resolve_stack(root, l, Default)
  <Employee 1 2>
 
Locations
---------

Traject supports the notion of locations. After we find a model, the
model will have received two special attributes::

*  ``__name__``: the name we addressed this object with in the path

* ``__parent__``: the parent of the model. This is an model that
  matches the path without the last step.

The parent will in turn have a parent as well, all the way up to the
ultimate ancestor, the root.

We can look at the object we retrieved before to demonstrate the
ancestor chain::

  >>> obj.__name__
  u'2'
  >>> isinstance(obj, Employee)
  True
  >>> p1 = obj.__parent__
  >>> p1.__name__ 
  u'employees'
  >>> isinstance(p1, Default)
  True
  >>> p2 = p1.__parent__
  >>> p2.__name__
  u'1'
  >>> isinstance(p2, Default)
  True
  >>> p3 = p2.__parent__
  >>> p3.__name__
  u'departments'
  >>> isinstance(p3, Default)
  True
  >>> p3.__parent__ is root
  True

Default objects have been created for each step along the way, up
until the root.

Consuming a path
----------------

In a mixed traject/traversal environment, for instance where view
lookup is done by traversal, it can be useful to be able to resolve a
path according to the patterns registered until no longer
possible. The rest of the the steps are not followed.

The method consume will consume steps as far as possible, return the
steps that weren't consumed yet, and the object it managed to find::

  >>> unconsumed, last_obj = patterns.consume(root, 
  ...       'departments/1/some_view', Default)
  >>> unconsumed
  ['some_view']
  >>> isinstance(last_obj, Default)
  True
  >>> last_obj.__name__
  '1'
  >>> p1 = last_obj.__parent__ 
  >>> p1.__name__
  'departments'
  >>> p1.__parent__ is root
  True

The method ``consume_stack`` does the same with a stack::

  >>> l = ['departments', '1', 'some_view']
  >>> l.reverse()
  >>> unconsumed, last_obj = patterns.consume_stack(root, l, Default)
  >>> unconsumed
  ['some_view']
  >>> isinstance(last_obj, Default)
  True
  >>> last_obj.__name__
  '1'
  >>> p1 = last_obj.__parent__ 
  >>> p1.__name__
  'departments'
  >>> p1.__parent__ is root
  True

Giving a model its location
---------------------------

When we retrieve a model directly by means of a query or construction
in our application code (such as in our view logic) it will not have a
location. This is inconvenient if we want to ask the model questions
that need such location information (such as its URL or its
location-dependent permissions).

We can register a special function per model class that is the inverse
of the factory. Given a model instance, it needs to return the
arguments used in the pattern towards it::

  >>> def employee_arguments(obj):
  ...     return {'employee_id': obj.employee_id, 
  ...             'department_id': obj.department_id} 
  >>> patterns.register_inverse(Root, Employee, pattern_str, employee_arguments)

Let's construct some employee now::

  >>> m = Employee(u'13', u'27')

It has no location (no ``__name__`` or ``__parent__``)::

  >>> m.__name__
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  AttributeError: ...

  >>> m.__parent__
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  AttributeError: ...

We can now locate it::

  >>> patterns.locate(root, m, Default)

The model will now have ``__name__`` and ``__parent__`` attributes::

  >>> m.__name__
  u'27'
  >>> p1 = m.__parent__
  >>> p1.__name__
  u'employees'
  >>> p2 = p1.__parent__
  >>> p2.__name__
  u'13'
  >>> p3 = p2.__parent__
  >>> p3.__name__
  u'departments'
  >>> p3.__parent__ is root
  True
