Overview
========

The zc.testbrowser package provides web user agents (browsers) with
programmatic interfaces designed to be used for testing web applications,
especially in conjunction with doctests.  This project originates in the Zope 3
community, but is not Zope-specific.

There are currently three type of testbrowser provided.  One for accessing web
sites via HTTP (zc.testbrowser.browser), one that controls a Firefox web
browser (zc.testbrowser.real), and one for directly accessing a Zope 3
application (zope.testbrowser.testing, available seperately).
