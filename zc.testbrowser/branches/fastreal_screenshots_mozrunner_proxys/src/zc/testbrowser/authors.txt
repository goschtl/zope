Benji York created testbrowser (originally zope.testbrowser) in 2005 with Gary
Poster and Stephan Richter making large contributions.

The zc.testbrowser.real version was conceptualized by Benji York in 2007 and
after an initial implementation sketch, brought to fruition by Stephan
Richter, Rocky Burt, Justas Sadzevicius, and others at the Foliage Zope 3
sprint in Boston, MA during the week of September 24, 2007.

Mathieu Pasquet added recently proxy support and improved the real browser class.

There have been many other contributions from users of testbrowser that are
greatly appreciated.
