===================
ldapadapter changes
===================

under development
=================

Features added
--------------

* Fixed Zope 3.3 induced deprecation warnings.

Bugs fixed
----------

* The LDAP Adapter Vocabulary list (used by ldappas) was showing an
  enormous list of irrelevant things. Instead only show those
  LDAPAdapters that were registered. Note: each ldapadapter must be
  registered with a particular *name* for it to show up properly in
  the user interface of ldappas now...
