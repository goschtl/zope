ZODB - a native object database for Python
==========================================

    Don't squeeze your objects into tables: store them in an object database.

The Zope Object Database (ZODB) provides seamless object persistence in Python.
It gets rid of requiring a relational database for your object-oriented
application and provides you with a powerful and safe object sore:
persistence, transactions, scalability, :doc:`and more<overview>`.
