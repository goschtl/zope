Bugs
====

General bug reporting happens in the `Launchpad bug
tracker<http://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb>`_.

However, the ZODB has been around much longer and thus there are some historic
resource for bug-related information.:

* Zope collector (with topic `database`) at http://collector.zope.org/Collectors/Zope
* ZODB sourceforge bug tracker (much older) at http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=15628&atid=115628
