Version 0.5.1dev (unreleased)
-----------------------------

- Updated test and demo app to run with ZTK 1.0, thus requiring zam.api >=
  0.7.

- Fixed ErrorReportingUtility edit form. The form was ignoring the
  ``ignored_exceptions`` attribute because of ignoreContext=True and could not
  store the ``keep_entries`` value because of broken implementation.

- Added tests for edit.html page.


0.5.0 (2008-04-14)
------------------

- Initial release.
