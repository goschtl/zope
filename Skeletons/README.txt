Skeletons
=========

Each directory under ``Skeletons`` is a template
for a different sort of Zope-related project.
If you start your Zope project
by making a Subversion copy of one of these templates
using the ``svn cp`` command,
you will not only avoid having to generate boilerplate yourself,
but will very slightly reduce the size of the repository
by letting your own files inherit history from the central copy
in the skeleton.

One skeleton is currently available:

``megrok/``
 Use this when creating a ``megrok.NAME`` Grok community project.
