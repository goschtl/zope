1.0 (unreleased)
================

- Using Python's ``doctest`` module instead of depreacted
  ``zope.testing.doctest``.

- Updated tests to run on Python 2.6, too.


1.0b2 (2009-03-12)
==================

- Fixed: internal data structures were not stored correctly in the ZODB, so
  BLists loaded from a fresh DB connection would break.

- Removed unused code and the dependency on rwproperty.

- Improved test coverage of the BList API, fixed access to items at index -1
  or at the ends of the valid index range.


1.0b1 (2008-10-06)
==================

- Initial release.
