Installation
============

  1. Copy the 'bugtracker' folder to 'ZOPE3/src' in any other directory listed
     in the PYTHONPATH. At the end you need to be able to import the bugtracker
     without any prefixes:

       >>> import bugtracker

  2. Add a file named 'bugtracker-configure.zcml' in the
     'ZOPE3/package-includes' directory containing the following line:

       <include package='bugtracker' />

  3. You need to define the following role declarations to your user in order
     to use the bug tracker product effectively.

      <grant role="bugtracker.Admin" principal="user" />
      <grant role="bugtracker.Editor" principal="user" />
      <grant role="bugtracker.User" principal="user" />

      <grant role="bugtracker.User" principal="anybody" />
