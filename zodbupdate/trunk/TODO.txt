TODO
====

- Write out rewritten class names to file that can be read for offline
  updating.

- Provide "offline" updating: read a list of old/new pairs and update pickles
  directly without needing the old code. Use setuptools entry points for
  discovering those mappings?

- Review and accordingly improve logging.
