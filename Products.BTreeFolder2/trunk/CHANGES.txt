Changelog
=========

2.13.0 (unreleased)
-------------------

- Change implementation of `keys`, `items` and `values` method to access the
  `self._tree` OOBTree methods directly. This avoids lookups in the meta_types
  structures.

- Implement the full dictionary protocol including `__getitem__`,
  `__delitem__`, `__setitem__`, `__nonzero__`, `__iter__` and `__contains__`.

- Released as separate package.
