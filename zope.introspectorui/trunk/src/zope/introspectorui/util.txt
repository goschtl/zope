Helpers for the zope.introspectorui

:Test-Layer: functional

This module provides some helpers, mainly for dealing with
URLs.

CodeBreadcrumbProvider
======================

An adapter that provides HTML breadcrumbs for a certain code view.

We construct a package representation for ``zope.introspector``::

  >>> from zope.introspector.code import Package
  >>> pkg = Package('zope.introspector')

Now we get the appropriate info object for this representation. This
is normally done using adapters, but we can shorten the way here and
use the ``PackageInfo`` directly::

  >>> from zope.introspector.code import PackageInfo
  >>> info = PackageInfo(pkg)

To create an appropriate view, however, we need a request::

  >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
  >>> request = TestRequest()

Finally we can create the view::

  >>> from zope.introspectorui.code import Package as PackageView
  >>> view = PackageView(info, request)

We can now get breadcrumbs for this view using the adapter. This
adapter provides support for objects, that implement
``zope.introspectorui.interfaes.ICodeView`` only::

  >>> from zope.introspectorui.interfaces import IBreadcrumbProvider
  >>> from zope.component import getAdapter
  >>> provider = IBreadcrumbProvider(view)
  >>> provider
  <zope.introspectorui.util.CodeBreadcrumbProvider object at 0x...>

This provider gives us the breadcrumbs for the view of the
`zope.introspector` package as HTML code::

  >>> provider.getBreadcrumbs()
  '<a href="http://.../zope">zope</a>.<a href="http://.../zope/introspector">introspector</a>'
