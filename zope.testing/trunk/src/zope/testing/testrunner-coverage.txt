Code Coverage
-------------

If the --coverage option is used, test coverage reports will be generated.  The
directory name given as the parameter will be used to hold the reports.


    >>> import os.path, sys
    >>> directory_with_tests = os.path.join(this_directory, 'testrunner-ex')
    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', directory_with_tests,
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^sampletestsf?$',
    ...     ]

    >>> sys.argv = 'test --coverage=coverage_dir'.split()

    >>> from zope.testing import testrunner
    >>> testrunner.run(defaults)

The directory specified with the --coverage option will have been created and
will hold the coverage reports.

    >>> os.path.exists('coverage_dir')
    True
    >>> os.listdir('coverage_dir')
    [...]

(We should clean up after ourselves.)

    >>> import shutil
    >>> shutil.rmtree('coverage_dir')
