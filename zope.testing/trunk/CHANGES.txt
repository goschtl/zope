zope.testing Package Changelog
=============================

zope.testing version 2.x.y (???)
--------------------------------

- Fix the test coverage. If a module, for example `interfaces`, was in an
  ignored directory/package, then if a module of the same name existed in a
  covered direcotry/package, then it was also ignored there, because the
  ignore cache stored the result by module name and not the filename of the
  module.

zope.testing version 2.0 (2006/01/05)
--------------------------------------

- Corresponds to the verison of the zope.testing package shipped as part of
  the Zope 3.2.0 release.
