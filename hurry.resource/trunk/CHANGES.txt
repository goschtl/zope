0.2 (unreleased)
================

* Changed the API to set the mode. Instead of passing it to ``render``
  and ``inclusions``, the requested mode can be set with the ``mode``
  method on ``INeededInclusions``. For convenience there is a ``mode``
  function as well that can be imported directly from
  ``hurry.resource`` that sets the mode for the current needed
  inclusions.

0.1 (2008-10-07)
================

* Initial public release.
