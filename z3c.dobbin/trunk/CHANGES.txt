Change log
==========

0.3 dev
-------

- Implemented polymorphic relations for a subset of the basic types
  (int, str, unicode, tuple and list).

0.2.9
-----

- Tables are now only created once per minimal interface; this fixes
  issue on both SQLite and Postgres when we create mappers with an
  explicit polymorphic class.
