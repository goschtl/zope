TODO
====

- Compress repeated warnings, ignore warnings that are known to come from the
  framework (factory PermissionSetting: Allow does not have __name__, can't
  check canonical location)

- Provide "offline" updating: read a list of old/new pairs and update pickles
  directly without needing the old code. Use setuptools entry points for
  discovering those mappings?

- Improve logging after refactoring

- Write out rewritten class names to file that can be read for offline
  updating.
