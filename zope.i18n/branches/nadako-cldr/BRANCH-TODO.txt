=================
CLDR upgrade plan
=================

The purpose of this branch is to update locale data to latest version
of CLDR. Current zope.i18n has the very first version of the data and
it's really very hard to update the data to latest version at once, as
there's many structure changes and many new entities were introduced.

So, we'll update the CLDR data version by version, implementing new and
changed interfaces and functionality for each version, starting with 1.1,
where month/day contexts and widths were introduced. We'll try hard to
maintain full backward compatibility with earlier locale interfaces.

CLDR 1.1 (LDML 1.1)
-------------------

Updated the XML files and fixed incompatibilities.

Still need to add interface/implementation for day/month context
and day/month width system.

Review other non-critical changes and implement them.

CLDR 1.2 (LDML 1.2)
-------------------

After that
----------

Use pickled python structures instead of reading XML files. Pickles
should be prepared during package build time.
