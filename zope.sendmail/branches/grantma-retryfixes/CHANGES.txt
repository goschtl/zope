- Restructured SMTP mailer and QueueProcessorThread so that all 
  SMTP error logic is in the mailer.  Clears the way for another 
  mailer for /usr/sbin/sendmail command line can be used with 
  QueueProcessorThread.
- Added ability for QueueProcessorThread so that it can handle temporary
  failures in delivery to its smart host - ie administrator reconfiguring
  mailserver, mail server reboot/restart
- Formatted log messages in a consistent fashion so that they can be grepped
  out of z3.log
- Added maildir message filename to log messages as message id - allows
  easy analysis/triage of mail message sending problems
- Added cleaning of lock links to QueueProcessorThread so that messages can be
  sent immediately on Zope3 restart.
- Added pollingInterval (ms), cleanLockLinks (boolean), and retryInterval 
  (seconds) configure options to configure.zcml.

3.5.0b1 (unreleased)
--------------------

- Added README.txt
- Can now talk to servers that don't implement EHLO
- Fix bug that caused files with very long names to be created
- Fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/157104: move aside mail that's
  causing 5xx server responses.


3.5.0a2 (2007-10-23)
--------------------

- Cleaned up ``does_esmtp`` in faux SMTP connection classes provided by the
  tests.
- If the ``QueueProcessorThread`` is asked to stop while sending messages, do
  so after sending the current message; previously if there were many, many
  messages to send, the thread could stick around for quite a while.


3.5.0a1 (2007-10-23)
--------------------

- ``QueueProcessorThread`` now accepts an optional parameter *interval* for
  defining how often to process the mail queue (default is 3 seconds)

- Several ``QueueProcessorThreads`` (either in the same process, or multiple
  processes) can now deliver messages from a single maildir without duplicates
  being sent.


3.4.0 (2007-08-20)
--------------------

- Bugfix: Don't keep open files around for every email message
  to be sent on transaction commit.  People who try to send many emails
  in a single transaction now will not run out of file descriptors.


3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
--------------------

Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to ``zope.sendmail``
from Zope 3.4.0a1.
