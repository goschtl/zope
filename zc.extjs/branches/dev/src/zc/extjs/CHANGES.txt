Release history
***************

This package is in a somewhat experimental state.  I *think* it's stable
enough that future changes are unlikely to break things.  

Future work
===========

- Better documentation and tests for the javascript part of the
  implementation.

- More widgets.

- Support for "live search" combo boxes that make ajax calls to update
  results as people refine searches.

0.1 (2008-03-??)
================

Initial public release.
