- Allow ImageResource, PageTemplateResource, and DTMLResource to
  monkeypatch their counterparts in Zope.

- Do "jackboot" import prevention by putting a wrapper around Basket
  in sys.modules (Basket is immediately deprecated; it is a stopgap
  until we get support for egg distributions in the Zope core).

- Cause egg-distribution-packaged Products to show up in the Control
  Panel -> Products area.

- Cause module-scope resources like "misc_", "methods", "__roles__",
  and so on to be registered (see OFS.Application.install_product).

- Passing Basket's "context" in to each subproducts' initialize
  function is wrong; instead we need to create a ProductContext object
  specially for the product (see OFS.Application.install_product).
