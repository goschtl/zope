Old product initialization routine in prose:

- get an ordered list with product data in it (apparently plugin
  indexes must come first, otherwise the list contains (priority,
  product name, counter in loop, name of place this product is
  found on Products.__path__)

- import each product in the order it's defined in the ordered list
  (from within Zope2.startup.startup)

  create a seen dict

  using the seen dict, warn if a product has duplicate installations

  respect __module_aliases__ at import time...

     for k, v in aliases:

        if we don't have the target module already...

             set the source module into the target module's name in sys.modules

  if the product can't be imported, set package.__import_error__
  to the traceback value

- get "folder_permissions":

     folder_permissions={}
     for p in Folder.Folder.__ac_permissions__:
         permission, names = p[:2]
         folder_permissions[permission]=names
     return folder_permissions

- create emtpy meta_types list

- create seen dict for products

- figure out if we're in debug mode or not

- commit a transaction (with a note: 'Prior to product installs')

- for each set of product data in the ordered product list:

  if it's seen, continue

  make it seen

  install_product (mutating meta_types list as we go, we also pass in
  folder permissions and whether we raise on error)

    set __traceback_info__ to the product's name (not its dotted path)

    import the product package

    look for misc_ on the package (uses "pgetattr"; if it exists and
    it's a dictionary, create a Misc_ object entry in
    Application.misc_.__dict__[product_name].

    find or create the "product object" (a persistent object in the
    control panel).

       look for '__import_error__' on the product package (set during
       the import phase)

       read the contents of version.txt in the package as fver

       look for the product_name as an attr of the C_P.Products
       object (using 'ihasattr')

       if we find one, and its version is the same as fver and it is
       the victim of a pior import error that's the same as the
       current import error for the product, return the old product.

       otherwise, create a Product object using the product_name and
       version)

       if we're dealing with a case where we have an existing product
       in the control panel, but it's the victim of a different import
       error than the 'old' product, do
       app._manage_remove_product_meta_type(productObject), delete the
       object from C_P.Products, and reset all of the objectitems from
       the old productobject into the new productobject.  Don't fail.

       set the productobject into C_P.Products using _setObject (its
       name is just the product name)

       set productObject.icon = 'p_/InstalledProduct_icon'

       set productobject.version = fver

       set product.home to the product's full directory name
       (e.g. "<instancehome>/Products/Productname"

       set product.manage_options = (Folder.manage_options[0],) +
                                     tuple(Folder.manage_options[2:])

       set product._distribution = None

       set product.manage_distribution = None

       set product.thisIsAnInstalledProduct = 1

       if there was an import error:

           set product.import_error_ to the error traceback text

           set product.title = 'Broken product <productname>'

           set product.icon = 'p_/BrokenProduct_icon'

           set product.manage_options = ( {'label':'Traceback', 
                                           'action':'manage_traceback'}, )

        if there's a readme.txt in the product, add ({label:'README',
          'action':'manage_readme'},) to the manage_options of the product

        set up a refresh tab on the product if one doesn't already exist...

          product.manage_options = product.manage_options + (
            {'label':'Refresh', 'action':'manage_refresh',
             'help': ('OFSP','Product_Refresh.stx')},)

        if we're not really doing an install, abort the transaction

        otherwise, set Globals.__disk_product_installed__ = 1

        return the product

    manufacture a product context using the product object.

    call the product package's 'initialize' method

    set new_permissions = {}

    support old-style product metadata...

      if the package has an __ac_permissions__... (using pgetattr)...

          for p in pgetattr(product, '__ac_permissions__', ()):
                permission, names, default = (
                    tuple(p)+('Manager',))[:3]
                if names:
                    for name in names:
                        permissions[name]=permission
                elif not folder_permissions.has_key(permission):
                    new_permissions[permission]=()

      if the package has a meta_types attr (using pgetattr):

            for meta_type in pgetattr(product, 'meta_types', ()):
                # Modern product initialization via a ProductContext
                # adds 'product' and 'permission' keys to the meta_type
                # mapping. We have to add these here for old products.
                pname=permissions.get(meta_type['action'], None)
                if pname is not None:
                    meta_type['permission']=pname
                meta_type['product']=productObject.id
                meta_type['visibility'] = 'Global'
                meta_types.append(meta_type)

     if the package has a "methods" attribute (using pgetattr):

            for name,method in pgetattr(
                product, 'methods', {}).items():
                if not hasattr(Folder.Folder, name):
                    setattr(Folder.Folder, name, method)
                    if name[-9:]!='__roles__': # not Just setting roles
                        if (permissions.has_key(name) and
                            not folder_permissions.has_key(
                                permissions[name])):
                            permission=permissions[name]
                            if new_permissions.has_key(permission):
                                new_permissions[permission].append(name)
                            else:
                                new_permissions[permission]=[name]

     if new permissions were added...

            if new_permissions:
                new_permissions=new_permissions.items()
                for permission, names in new_permissions:
                    folder_permissions[permission]=names
                new_permissions.sort()
                Folder.Folder.__ac_permissions__=tuple(
                    list(Folder.Folder.__ac_permissions__)+new_permissions)

    if we're not really installing, do transaction.abort()

    otherwise, transaction.note('Installed product <productname>') and commit

    if any of the above fails, abort the transaction.  if we're in debug
    mode, raise the exception

- Set Products.meta_types = Products.meta_types + tuple(meta_types)

- Globals.default__class_init__(Folder.Folder) # why?
