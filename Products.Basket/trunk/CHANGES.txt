0.2
   Added support allowing for CMF based applications to not have to use the
   'Products' namespace.

   Monkey-patch Five's findProducts method to not just look in the Products
   module but also in all product packages made available by Basket.
   
   Monkey-patch CMF's TypesTool (if CMF is available) so that it is able
   to find product packages exposed by Basket as well.
   
   Monkey-patch Zope's ProductDispatcher so that it can look for factory
   methods/info that are exposed by product packages that are not just in the
   'Products' namespace.

   Monkey-patch Zope's external method machinery to look for external
   method files in exploded tempdirs.

   Unpack non-zip-safe eggs into a cache directory instead of a
   per-process temp directory.

   Fix missing imports and missing function parameters which exposed
   failures only during certain error condidions.

   Fixed a bug where inspecting a zipfile distribution which was later
   blown out to a tempdir caused inappropriate turds to be left on
   that distributions' namespace packages' __path__(s).
