- Investigate using easy_install instead of exploding non-zip-safe
  zipfiles at runtime.  Phillip Eby comments:

  """
  In general, it seems to me that your scan and setup process is more
  complex than necessary.  I tend to feel as though you should just
  have people use easy_install to install their eggs in the target
  directory, and tell it that the egg direcotry is a "site" directory
  (i.e., can use .pth files).  E.g., using:

    easy_install -d eggdir --site-dirs=eggdir myproject.egg

  This will copy in any non-product eggs required by the project that
  aren't already in sys.path, *and* extract any non-zipsafe eggs, as
  well as select active versions in the .pth file.  Then, your
  preinitialization code could be as simple as:

    # process the .pth file
    import site; site.addsitedir(eggdir)

    # update the working set with added eggs
    for entry in sys.path:
        if entry not in working_set.entries:
            working_set.add_entry(entry)

  This would be a lot simpler than all of the hoops you're currently
  jumping through to get the working_set configured.  You would only
  need to document one installation technique, not two.  And you can
  always wrap easy_install with a more convenient interface, if
  desired.

- When an egg distribution is uninstalled, its persistent object
  sticks around in the control panel.  It should go away.

- Hurt system files aren't registered or displayed.

- Tracebacks from zipfile egg products don't include code from inside
  the egg.  Investigate this more (check if this is a known bug).

- Figure out what to do about products with the same name while
  iterating over their entry points.
