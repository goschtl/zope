====================
The Tutorial Session
====================

A tutorial session is created whenever a user watches or takes a tutorial. A
session is an adapter to a tutorial, so we have to create that first:

  >>> import os, tempfile
  >>> temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
  >>> sample_txt = os.path.join(temp_dir, 'sample.txt')

  >>> open(sample_txt, 'w').write('''
  ... Sample Documentation
  ... ====================
  ...
  ... Here is a simple print statement:
  ...
  ...   >>> print 'sample'
  ...   sample
  ...
  ... And now a variable assignment with a return value:
  ...
  ...   >>> id = 5
  ...   >>> id
  ...   5
  ...
  ... That's it!
  ... ''')

  >>> from zope.tutorial import tutorial
  >>> sample = tutorial.Tutorial('Sample Documentation', sample_txt)

Now that we have the tutorial, we can create a session:

  >>> session = tutorial.TutorialSession(sample)
  >>> session.initialize()

Nothing is setup until ``initialize()`` is called. Once the session is
prepared, we can choose a controller that knows about the input and output
interfaces. The simplest controller is the `SimpleCLIController`, which simply
displays the text and examples:

  >>> from zope.tutorial import cli
  >>> controller = cli.SimpleCLIController(session)

Since we are in a unit test file already, the Python prompt needs to be
changed, so that the test does not get confused:

  >>> controller.PYTHON_PROMPT = 'Py: '

We can now write a simple function that runs the tutorial for us:

  >>> def run():
  ...     controller.start()
  ...     while controller.running:
  ...         controller.doNextStep()

  >>> run()

  Here is a simple print statement:

  And now a variable assignment with a return value:
