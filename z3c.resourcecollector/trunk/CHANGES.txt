Create zcml directives for creating a custom resource.
It collects javascripts and css files and merges them into a single resource.
It behaves exactly as a normal resource.
Also provides 2 viewlets JSCollectorViewlet, and CSSCollectorViewlet.
These viewlets are returning the html element what can reach the collector resource.
Also adds a hash in the end of the resource for versionning.
