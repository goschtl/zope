Bobo
====

Bobo is a light-weight framework for creating WSGI web applications.

It's goal is to be easy to use and remember.

It addresses 2 problems:

- Mapping URLs to objects

- Calling objects to generate HTTP responses

Bobo doesn't have a templating language, a database integration layer,
or a number of other features that are better provided by WSGI
middle-ware or application-specific libraries.

Bobo builds on other frameworks, most notably WSGI and WebOb.
