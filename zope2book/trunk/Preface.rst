Preface

  Welcome to *The Zope Book*.  This book is designed to introduce you
  to *Zope*, an open-source web application server.

  To make effective use of the book, you should know how to use a web
  browser and have a basic understanding of the *Hyper
  Text Markup Language* (HTML) and *Uniform Resource Locators* (URLs).  You
  don't need to be a highly-skilled programmer in order to use Zope,
  but you may find the understanding of some programming concepts (particularly in object-oriented
  programming) to be extremely helpful.

How the Book Is Organized

    A brief summary of each chapter is presented
    below:

    1. Introducing Zope

        This chapter explains what Zope is and what it can do for you.
        You'll also learn about the differences between Zope and other
        web application servers.

    2. Zope Concepts and Architecture

        This chapter explains fundamental Zope concepts and describes
        the basics about Zope's architecture.

    3. Installing and Starting Zope

        This chapter explains how to install and start Zope for the
        first time.  By the end of this chapter, you will have Zope
        installed and working.

    4. Object Orientation

        This chapter explains the concept of *object orientation*,
        which is the development methodology most often used to
        create Zope applications.

    5. Using the Zope Management Interface

        This chapter explains how to use Zope's web-based management
        interface. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to
        navigate around the Zope object space, copy and move objects,
        and use other basic Zope features.

    6. Using Basic Zope Objects

        This chapter introduces *objects*, which are the most
        important elements of Zope.  You'll learn the basic Zope
        objects: content objects, presentation objects, and logic
        objects, and you'll build a simple application using these
        objects.

    7. Acquisition

        This chapter introduces *acquisition*, which is Zope's
        mechanism for sharing site behavior and content.

    8. Basic DTML

        This chapter introduces *DTML*, Zope's tag-based scripting
        language.  You'll learn DTML syntax, its basic tags, 
        and how to use DTML templates and
        scripting facilities.  After reading this chapter,
        you'll be able to create dynamic web pages.

    9. Using Zope Page Templates

        This chapter introduces *Zope Page Templates*, another Zope tool
        used to create dynamic web pages. You will learn about basic
        template statements that let you insert dynamic content, and how
        to create and edit page templates.

    10. Creating Basic Zope Applications  

        This chapter presents several real-world
        examples of building a Zope application.  You'll learn how to
        use basic Zope objects and how they can work together to form
        basic applications.

    11. Users and Security

        This chapter looks at how Zope handles users, authentication,
        authorization, and other security-related matters.

    12. Advanced DTML

        This chapter takes a closer look at DTML. You'll learn about DTML
        security, the tricky issue of how variables are looked up
        in DTML, advanced use of basic tags, 
        and the myriad of special purpose tags.

    13. Advanced Page Templates

        This chapter goes into more depth with Zope Page Templates. You will learn 
        all about template statements, expression
        types, and macros, which let you reuse presentation
        elements.

    14. Advanced Zope Scripting

        This chapter covers scripting Zope with Python and Perl.  You will learn
        how to write business logic in Zope using tools more
        powerful than DTML, about the idea of *scripts* in
        Zope, and about Python and Perl-based scripts.  This
        chapter shows you how to add industrial-strength scripting to
        your site.

    17. Zope Services

        This chapter covers Zope objects that are considered "services," which
        don't readily fit into any of the basic "content,"
        "presentation," or "logic" object groups.

    15. Searching and Categorizing Content

        This chapter shows you how to index and search objects with
        Zope's built-in search engine: the *Catalog*. You'll learn about 
        indexing concepts, different patterns for
        indexing and searching, metadata, and
        search results. 

    16. Relational Database Connectivity

        This chapter describes how Zope connects to external
        relational databases.  You'll learn about features that allow you
        to treat relational data as though it were Zope
        objects, and security and performance
        considerations.

    17. Virtual Hosting Services

        This chapter explains how to set up Zope in a "virtual hosting"
        environment, in which Zope sub-folders can be served as "top-level"
        host names.  It includes examples that allow virtual hosting to
        be performed either "natively" or using Apache's 'mod_rewrite'
        facility.

    18. Sessions

        This chapter describes Zope's "sessioning" services, which allow
        Zope developers to "keep state" between HTTP requests.

    19. Scalability and ZEO

        This chapter covers issues and solutions for building and
        maintaining large web applications, and focuses on issues of
        management and scalability. In particular, the Zope Enterprise
        Option (ZEO) is covered in detail.  You'll learn about the
        tools and techniques needed to turn a small site into a
        large-scale site, servicing many simultaneous visitors.

    20. Managing Zope Objects Using External Tools

        This chapter explains how to use tools outside of your web
        browser to manipulate Zope objects.

    21. Extending Zope

        This chapter covers extending Zope by creating your own
        classes of objects. You'll learn about *ZClasses*, how instances
        are built from classes, and how to build a ZClass and
        its attendant security and design issues.  You'll also learn how to create 
        Python base classes for ZClasses, and about 
        the base classes that ship with Zope.

    22. Maintaining Zope

        This chapter covers Zope maintenance and administration tasks,
        such as database "packing" and Product installation.

    23. Appendix A: DTML Reference

        Reference of DTML syntax and commands.

    24. Appendix B:  API Reference

        Reference of Zope object APIs.

    25. Appendix C:  Page Template Reference

        Reference of Zope Page Template syntax and commands.

    25. Appendix D:  Zope Resources

        Reference of "resources" which can be used to further enhance
        your Zope learning experience.

    26. Appendix E: DTML Name Lookup Rules

        Describes DTML's name lookup rules.
