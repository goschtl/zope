General
=======

- The various webserver related chapters should mention repoze/WSGI instead
  of the FastCGI/PCGI stuff.

- Some more clarification of Zope3 - Zope Components is required.

- External links needs to be checked and updated (Sphinx: make linkcheck).

InstallingZope
==============

- Rewrite the installation chapter to cover buildout, eggs, virtualenv and
  the modern world (Since this is 2.12, we don't need to document the old
  full tarball release anymore).

  Tres has written something in the install.txt inside the Zope2/trunk

- Refer to the plone.org/how-to/buildout-on-windows stuff for compiling from
  source on Windows. Make sure we get binary eggs of all dependencies and
  ourselves for normal installations.

ZopeArchitecture.rst
====================

- This uses ../Figures/zopearchitecture.gif which still includes ZClasses and
  should replace the `Products` naming with a more general packages.
