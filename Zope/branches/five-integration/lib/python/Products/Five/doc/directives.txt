=================================
ZCML Directives supported by Five
=================================

Five tries to use the Zope 3 ZCML directives where possible, though
does sometimes subset the possible attributes. It also introduces a
few directives of its own under the ``five`` namespace.

Directives are listed per namespace, in alphabetic order.
