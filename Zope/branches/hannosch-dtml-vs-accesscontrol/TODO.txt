Standalone AccessControl and DTML
=================================

Open general points:

- There's one test failure in RestrictedPython in
  ``test_sequence_in_utility_builtins_if_importable``. It does a conditional
  import of DocumentTemplate and executes some code. This should move into
  DocumentTemplate itself and avoid the import order problems we have now.

AccessControl
-------------

- Acceptable dependencies (we can improve on that later):

  * zope.component
  * zope.configuration
  * zope.deferredimport
  * zope.interface
  * zope.publisher
  * zope.schema
  * zope.security
  * zExceptions
  * Acquisition
  * ExtensionClass
  * Persistence
  * Record
  * RestrictedPython
  * ZODB3

- Remaining outside imports:

  * Products (in registerPermissions using it as a data container for
    ``__ac_permissions__``) - this should use a global inside the module
    inside AccessControl.

  * App (MessageDialog, DTMLFile, ...) - all need to go - redoing the UI is
    hard. We probably need to move it into some other core part of Zope2, like
    the App package, which could serve as a general dumping ground for ZMI
    related stuff from "reusable" packages.

- Test only dependencies:

  * OFS
  * Products.PythonScripts
  * Products.SiteErrorLog
  * Testing
  * transaction
  * Zope2

DocumentTemplate
----------------

- TreeDisplay should be moved into the DocumentTemplate distribution, the two
  depend on each other.

- Acceptable dependencies (we can improve on that later):

  * zope.sequencesort
  * zope.structuredtext
  * AccessControl (once it is its own distribution)
  * Acquisition
  * ExtensionClass
  * Missing
  * RestrictedPython
  * zExceptions

- Remaining outside imports:

  * App (getConfiguration().structured_text_header_level)
  * reStructuredText (HTML) - Both of these deal with format support and
    configuration via zope.conf. The calls are localized to one function each.
    Add an optional dependency on Zope2? Configure if it is available,
    otherwise use some default?

  * zExceptions - move it to its own distribution

- Test only dependencies:

  * Products.PythonScripts
