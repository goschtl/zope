Standalone AccessControl and DTML
=================================

Open general points:

- DocumentTemplate.security doesn't respect the security policy definition as
  set by AccessControl anymore. It determines the use of the C implementation
  based on the availability of the C module alone. This behavior change needs
  discussion.

AccessControl
-------------

- Acceptable dependencies (we can improve on that later):

  * zope.component
  * zope.configuration
  * zope.deferredimport
  * zope.interface
  * zope.publisher
  * zope.schema
  * zope.security
  * Acquisition
  * ExtensionClass
  * Persistence
  * Record
  * RestrictedPython
  * ZODB3

- Remaining outside imports:

  * Products (in registerPermissions using it as a data container for
    ``__ac_permissions__``) - this should use a global inside the module
    inside AccessControl.

  * zExceptions (Forbidden, Unauthorized, ...) - move those into
    zope.exceptions instead and import from there?

  * App (MessageDialog, DTMLFile, ...) - all need to go - redoing the UI is
    hard.

- Test only dependencies:

  * OFS
  * Products.PythonScripts
  * Products.SiteErrorLog
  * Testing
  * transaction
  * Zope2

DocumentTemplate
