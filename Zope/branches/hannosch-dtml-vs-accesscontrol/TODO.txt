Standalone AccessControl and DTML
=================================

Open general points:

- DocumentTemplate.security doesn't respect the security policy definition as
  set by AccessControl anymore. It determines the use of the C implementation
  based on the availability of the C module alone. This behavior change needs
  discussion.

- zExceptions needs to be its own distribution, possibly merge with
  zope.exceptions, which contains similar and sometimes identical code.

AccessControl
-------------

- Acceptable dependencies (we can improve on that later):

  * zope.component
  * zope.configuration
  * zope.deferredimport
  * zope.interface
  * zope.publisher
  * zope.schema
  * zope.security
  * Acquisition
  * ExtensionClass
  * Persistence
  * Record
  * RestrictedPython
  * ZODB3

- Remaining outside imports:

  * Products (in registerPermissions using it as a data container for
    ``__ac_permissions__``) - this should use a global inside the module
    inside AccessControl.

  * zExceptions (Forbidden, Unauthorized, ...)

  * App (MessageDialog, DTMLFile, ...) - all need to go - redoing the UI is
    hard, we probably need to move it into some other core part of Zope2, like
    the App package.

- Test only dependencies:

  * OFS
  * Products.PythonScripts
  * Products.SiteErrorLog
  * Testing
  * transaction
  * Zope2

DocumentTemplate
----------------

- TreeDisplay should be moved into the DocumentTemplate distribution, the two
  depend on each other.

- Acceptable dependencies (we can improve on that later):

  * zope.sequencesort
  * zope.structuredtext
  * AccessControl (once it is its own distribution)
  * Acquisition
  * ExtensionClass
  * Missing
  * RestrictedPython

- Remaining outside imports:

  * App (getConfiguration)
  * reStructuredText (HTML)
  * Shared (TaintedString)
  * zExceptions

- Test only dependencies:

  * Products.PythonScripts
