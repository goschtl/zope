Mild proxies
============

Mild proxies (mproxies) are security proxies that are designed to
provide backward compatibility for Zope 2 while eintrocusing a more
robust protection system.  They differ from normal security proxies in
that they remove mproxies from arguments passed when calling the
procies.

    >>> from Zope2.security.mproxy import MProxy
    >>> from zope.security import checker 
    >>> def f(*args):
    ...     return [type(a).__name__ for a in args]

    >>> class C(object):
    ...     pass

    >>> call_checker = checker.NamesChecker(['__call__'])

    >>> MProxy(f, call_checker)(MProxy(C(), call_checker))
    ['C']

Otherwise, mproxies are like regular security proxies:

    >>> from zope.security import proxy
    >>> isinstance(MProxy(C(), call_checker), proxy.Proxy)
    True
    >>> MProxy(C(), checker.NamesChecker([]))()
    ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ForbiddenAttribute: ('__call__', ...)
