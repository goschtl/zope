Signals are a posix inter-process communications mechanism.
If you are using Windows then this documentation is not
for you.

Zope responds to signals which are sent to the process id
written to the file /path/to/var/Z2.pid. 

    SIGHUP  - close open database connections and sockets,
              then restart the server process. The common
              idiom for restarting a Zope server is
              kill -SIGHUP `cat /path/to/var/z2.pid`

    SIGTERM - close open database connections and sockets,
              then shut down. The default stop script uses
              kill -SIGTERM `cat /path/to/var/Z2.pid`

    SIGUSR2 - close and re-open all Zope log files (z2.log,
              event log, detailed log.) The common idiom
              after rotating Zope log files is
              kill -SIGUSR2 `cat /path/to/var/z2.pid`

    SIGINT  - same as SIGTERM



Exactly which process has its pid written to this file 
depends on whether Zope is run under the management
process. If using a management process (the default)
then its pid is recorded here. Relevant signals sent to
the management process are forwarded on to the server
process. (Specifically, it forwards all those signals
listed above, plus SIGQUIT and SIGUSR1)

If not using a management process (-Z0 on the z2.py
command line) then the server process records its own
pid here.
