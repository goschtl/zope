Signals (POSIX only)

  Signals are a POSIX inter-process communications mechanism.
  If you are using Windows then this documentation does not apply.

  Zope responds to signals which are sent to the process id
  specified in the file 'ZOPE_HOME/var/Z2.pid'::

    SIGHUP  - close open database connections, then restart the server
              process. The common idiom for restarting a Zope server is:

              kill -HUP `cat ZOPE_HOME/var/z2.pid`

    SIGTERM - close open database connections then shut down. The common
              idiom for shutting down Zope is:

              kill -TERM `cat ZOPE_HOME/var/Z2.pid`

    SIGINT  - same as SIGTERM

    SIGUSR2 - close and re-open all Zope log files (z2.log, event log,
              detailed log.) The common idiom after rotating Zope log files
              is:

              kill -USR2 `cat ZOPE_HOME var/z2.pid`

  The process id written to the 'z2.pid' file depends on whether Zope
  is run under the 'zdaemon' management process. If Zope is run under
  a management process (as it is by default) then the pid of the
  management process is recorded here.  Relevant signals sent to the
  management process are forwarded on to the server process.
  Specifically, it forwards all those signals listed above, plus
  SIGQUIT and SIGUSR1.  If Zope is not using a management process (-Z0
  on the z2.py command line), the server process records its own pid
  into 'z2.pid', but all signals work the same way.
