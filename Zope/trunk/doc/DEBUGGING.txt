Running Zope in Debug Mode

  If you wish to run Zope in debug mode, use the -D command line
  switch.  This will have the following effect::

   o On UNIX, Zope will not detach from the controlling terminal.

   o Zope will print logging information to standard error.

   o The Z_DEBUG_MODE environment variable gets set, which causes some 
     other cool stuff in Zope to happen.
