Signals (POSIX only)

  Signals are a POSIX inter-process communications mechanism.
  If you are using Windows then this documentation does not apply.

  The ZEO storage server process (started with ZEO/start.py) responds to
  signals which are sent to the process id written to the file
  'ZOPE_HOME/var/ZEO_SERVER.pid'::

     SIGTERM - Close open storages and sockets, then shut down.

               kill -TERM `cat ZOPE_HOME/var/ZEO_SERVER.pid`

     SIGHUP  - Close open storages and sockets, then restart.

               kill -HUP `cat ZOPE_HOME/var/ZEO_SERVER.pid`

     SIGUSR2 - Rotate log files.

               kill -USR2 `cat ZOPE_HOME/var/ZEO_SERVER.pid`

  When using zdaemon (the default), the pid file contains the pid of
  the zdaemon process.  Otherwise (when the -s option is used), the
  pid file contains the storage server's own pid.

  Note that zdaemon forwards signals to the child process.
  Specifically, it forwards all those signals listed above, plus
  SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGUSR1.
