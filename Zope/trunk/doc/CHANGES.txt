Zope Changes

  This file contains change information for the current Zope release. 
  Change information for previous versions of Zope can be found in the
  file HISTORY.txt.

    Bugs Fixed

      - Collector #402: PythonScript recompile utility should only be 
        usable by Manager to prevent abuse.

      - Collector #433: Fixed broken Splitter backwards compatiblity
        issue caused by code cleanup.

      - Collector #151: The Python 2.1 / 2.2 fcntl compatibility hacks
        were bypassed when using medusa directly without importing 
        ZServer first (as when using monitor_client.py).

      - Collector #72: Start on Windows 95 machines with no network
        devices installed.

  Zope 2.6.0 alpha 1

    Features Added

      - Set the default sys checkinterval to a higher value (500) to 
        take better advantage of faster processors. Since there is no 
        way to scientifically determine a number that works best for 
        everyone, this at least should err on the side of better 
        performance "out of the box" for higher-end production
        systems.

        Note that you can always use the -i argument to z2 to change
        the check interval.

      - Added support for gzip content compression for clients that 
        support it. See lib/python/ZPublisher/HTTPResponse.py for more
        details.

      - Added ZCTextIndex plug-in index product. A replacement for TextIndex.

      - Removed the venerable but senile QuickStart folder from the
        default FileStorage.  "Alas, poor Yorick!  I knew him, Horatio."

      - Signal handling and log rotation

        All Zope process will respond to signals in the specified manner:

        SIGHUP  - close open database connections and sockets, then restart the
                  process

        SIGTERM - close open database connections and sockets, then shut down.

        SIGINT  - same as SIGTERM

        SIGUSR2 - rotate all Zope log files (z2.log, event log, detailed log)

        The common idiom for doing automated logfile rotation will become:

         kill -USR2 `cat /path/to/var/z2.pid`

        The common idiom for doing "prophylactic" restarts will become:

         kill -HUP `cat /path/to/var/z2.pid`

        When a process is interrupted via ctrl-C or via a TERM signal
        (INT, TERM), all open database connections and sockets will be closed 
        before the process dies.  This will speed up restart time for sites
        that use a FileStorage as its index will be written to the filesystem 
        before shutdown.

        Unspecified signals kill the process without doing cleanup.
    
      - ZCatalog no longer has a hand in managing text index vocabularies.
        The cruft associated with this functionality has been exorcised.
        No default indexes or metadata elements are defined for you when
        you create a new ZCatalog. Since we now have many new kinds of
        plug-in indexes it no longer made sense to do this
        anymore.        

      - A new permission "Copy or Move" was added.  This permission
        may be used respective to an object to prevent objects
        from being copyable or movable while within the management
        interface.  The "old" behavior stipulated that users whom
        possessed the "View management screens" permission to an object's
        container could copy or move the object arbitrarily, even if they
        had limited access to the object itself.  Once the object was
        moved or copied, the user became the owner of the new object,
        allowing them to see potentially sensitive information in
        the management interface for the object itself.  This permission
        is granted to Manager and Anonymous by default, and must be
        revoked on an object-by-object basis if site managers intend
        to provide management screen access to folders which contain
        sensitive subobjects.  This patch came as a result of 
        Collector #376 (thanks to Chris Deckard).

      - Structured Text's "DocumentWithImages" class did not recognize
        image filenames with underscores.

      - The getElementsByTagName method of STDOM (used by Structured Text)
        would croak on most documents, especially those containing
        unwrapped text nodes.  Fixed.
    
      - FileUpload objects now evaluate false when the have an empty file
        name. Making it easier to check for omitted file upload form fields.
    
      - ZClasses now use a python script as their constructor method
        instead of a DTML method. Also, ZClasses inherit from 
        CatalogPathAwareness now instead of CatalogAwareness.
    
      - added browser_default hook to ZPublisher. This allows objects to 
        specify the path to the default method that the publisher calls
        when the object is published. The default for objects not defining
        browser_default is still 'index_html' for bw compatibility.
        A ZMI configurable browser_default implementation has been added
        to ObjectManager. You can configure browser_default for OMs via
        a new "settings" management tab.

      - added TopicIndexes: a TopicIndex is a container for
        so-called FilteredSet. A FilteredSet consists of an
        expression and a set of internal ZCatalog document
        identifiers that represent a pre-calculated result list for
        performance reasons. Instead of executing the same query on
        a ZCatalog multiple times it is much faster to use a
        TopicIndex instead.

      - requestprofiler: added new --daysago option and added
        support for reading gzipped detailed logfiles

      - DateTime: new functions JulianDay() and week()
        to perform calculation of the week number based on the
        Julian calendar.

      - WebDAV: the new environment variable WEBDAV_SOURCE_PORT_CLIENTS
        enables retrieval of the document source for dedicated WebDAV 
        clients (see ENVIRONMENT.txt for usage)

      - Collector #272: Optimizations for RESPONSE.write

      - Collector #271: New environment variables are now used
        to send the access log into syslog. ZSYSLOG_ACCESS,
        ZSYSLOG_ACCESS_FACILITY, and SYSLOG_ACCESS_SERVER now
        do the same job as the old environment variables without
        _ACCESS in their name. Those old environment variables
        still do the same job of sending the event log to syslog.

      - When run as a daemon on Unix, Zope will now redirect
        stdin/stdout/stderr to /dev/null

      - Nicer formatting for the increasingly tall permissions
        table.

      - TextIndex: Enhanced splitter functionality now allows the
        TextIndex to index numbers, single characters. It is also 
        possible to enable case-sensitive indexing. The new 
        configuration options are available through the addForm
        of the Vocabulary object.

      - ICP server support. For more information see
        http://www.zope.org/Members/htrd/icp/intro

      - STXNG: added new env. variable STX_DEFAULT_LEVEL to change
        the default level for <Hx> elements (see doc/ENVIRONMENT.txt)

      - Collector #304: several catalog optimisations
        
      - New implementation of ZODB object cache.  The new
        implemenation is more likely to keep the size of the object
	cache close to the target size.  This change means that memory
	consumption may be reduced.  Some users will need to increase
	the default cache size, because a too small setting is more
	likely to hurt performance than it did in the past.

        Third-party C extensions that use the persistence API must be
        recompiled, and may need to be updated to work correctly with
        the new cache; see PER_GHOSTIFY().

      - The ZODB Connection is now resposible for registering changed
        objects with the current transaction.

      - Implementation of RestrictedCreation fishbowl proposal;
        Product registration can now include a function used to
        determine whether that product constructor want to allow
        objects to be created in the specified container object.

      - Collector 196: manage_page_style.css is now cacheable.
        Added freshness information to ImageFile, to improve
        cacheability of management interface

      - Collector 358: added a new parameter no_push_item to
        dtml-in, to inhibit automatically pushing sequence-item
        onto the namespace stack.

      - STXNG: Structured Text now supports images by default
        by using the HTMLWithImages class (has been disabled prior 
        to Zope 2.6)

      - new option --force-http-connection-close for z2.py to prevent
        clients from maintaing pipelined connections to the Zope server
        (Collector #412)

      - Updated the Interface package to be compatible with Zope 3
        Interfaces. This included changing some interface APIs that
        may affect existing products.

      - Added a database activity monitoring graph to the control panel,
        making it easier to tune the ZODB cache size.

    Bugs Fixed
    
      - External methods didn't properly setup func_defaults and func_code
        when they were first loaded. This meant mapply couldn't properly map
        arguments on the first try.
        
      - Fixed bug #96: Narrower/Wider buttons now work on both CSS and non-CSS
        compliant browsers. This allows better control for browsers that have a
        hard time knowing what 100% means.

      - Fix for Collector #319: filtered_manage_options didn't
        correctly filter tabs based on permission.

      - Made repr of an HTTPRequest.record eval'able as a dict (Collector
        #89).

      - Fixed bug #144: Upload button on dtml, py scripts, images, files and
        pts now raises an error if the file is not specified rather than
        clearing the source.
        
      - Fixed bug #275: setPermissionDefault didn't actually set the
        right permission -> role mappings.

      - Fixed bug reported on maillist during EWOULDBLOCK when using FTP server
        (http:// lists.zope.org/pipermail/zope/2002-March/111521.html).

      - App/FindHomes.py now computes the "real" path for SOFTWARE_HOME and
        INSTANCE_HOME, resolving any symlinks in any element within paths
        passed in via the INSTANCE_HOME or SOFTWARE_HOME envvars.  Paths that
        are computed by "dead reckoning" from os.getcwd and module paths are
        also "realpathed".  So for instance, if you use '/home/chrism/Instance'
        as your INSTANCE_HOME, and '/home/chrism' is a symlink to
        '/other/home/chrism', your INSTANCE_HOME will be computed as
        '/other/home/chrism/Instance'.  This is necessary to avoid
        weirdnesses while using "dead reckoning" from INSTANCE_HOME and
        SOFTWARE_HOME in other parts of the code.  POSIX systems only.

      - Fixed PropertyManager/PropertySheets so that you can safely add a
        property named 'ids' without breaking your properties page.

      - Removed spurious 'self' from scarecrow interfaces;  updated
        method-generation in Interface package to ignore self when
        source is a method (rather than a function).

      - Collector #32: Use difflib instead of ndiff

      - Fixed long standing bug in PythonScript where get_size returned
        the incorrect length. This broke editing using EMACS via FTP or
        WebDAV. Thanks to John Glavin at South River Technologies for
        help finding the bug.

      - Collector #207: fixed problem with inner links in STXNG

      - Collector #210: HTML() function of StructuredText produced wrong
        <h0> tags. 

      - Collector #166: ObjectManger.all_meta_types() implemented only
        an incomplete filter based on interfaces.

      - FTP: Downloading files through FTP has been broken since 2.4.0
        because the downloaded file has been stored with a HTTP 
        header at the beginning of the file. Fixed!

      - FTP: Spaces in usernames inside a FTP file listing are now
        replaced by underscores to avoid confusion with some FTP clients.

      - Collector #227: improved handling of unicode string in TextIndex.py
        with unmodified default encoding in site.py.

      - Collector #227: z2.py, TextIndex/dtml/manage_vocab.dtml modified 
        to display unicode strings in the vocabulary properly (now using
        UTF-8 encoding for display purposes)

      - Collector #250: applied several patches for TextIndex for better
        unicode support for the GlobbingLexicon

      - Collector #254: return owner object from getOwner wrapped in its
        context

      - Collector #259: walkandscrub.py did not delete all .pyc and .pyo
        files during installation. Fixed.

      - Collector #231: BTrees ignoring errors from comparison function

      - Collector #278: DocumentWithImages could not handle URLs with
        underscores

      - Collector #279: changed exception handling for safegmtime() to
        provide a more intuitive traceback for operating systems with a 
        limited gmtime() implementations

      - Collector #285: Zope changes its working directory
        to the var directory at startup

      - WebDAV: removing an non-existing property now returns a HTTP
        200-OK response instead of 404 (now compliant with RFC 2518)

      - Fixed a bug in TM.py that would cause database adapters to hang
        on errors in the second phase of the two-phase commit.

      - Collector #291: ZCatalog not unindexing deleted properties

      - Collector #266: Retried requests losing track of http request
        headers, causing Connection:Close requests to stall

      - Collector #17: Fixed broken links in StandardCacheManagers help

      - Collector #1: UNIX security fixes: make starting Zope as 'root'
        secure, stop using 'nobody', warn of insecure umasks

      - Collector #303: Properties of type 'long' got truncated 

      - Collector #325: adding a new TextIndex to an existing Catalog
        cleared the standard Vocabulary.

      - Collector #373: content_type property for Image objects
        are no longer deletable to prevent malfunction.

      - Collector #343: The ZCatalogs 'Indexes' view showed the 
        wrong number of indexed objects for FieldIndexes.

      - FTP server: replaced 'System_Process' by 'Sysproc' to 
        avoid breaking some FTP clients and the output format
        with overlong usernames.
      
      - Fixed a potential bug with cAccessControl's permission
        role deallocator which would try to decref things which
        may not have been set, due to a change in the initializer
        (which will bail out if it doesnt get called with a tuple
        argument)

      - Collector #185, 341: PCGIServer and FCGIServer logs corrected
        and now output extended information like HTTPServer does.

      - Propertysheets: Ids like 'values' and 'items' are 
        now forbidden as they break WebDAV functionality. Existing
        Propertysheets are not affected

      - Collector #348: decapitate() now recognizes both \r\n and \n\n
        to be compliant with the HTTP RFC

      - Collector #386: workaround for hanging FTP connections
        with NcFTP

      - Collector #419: repaired off-by-1 errors and IndexErrors
        when slicing BTree-based data structures.  For example,
        an_IIBTree.items()[0:0] had length 1 (should be empty) if
        the tree wsan't empty.
