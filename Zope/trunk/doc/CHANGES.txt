    Zope 2.4 alpha 2

      Bugs fixed

        - Corrections to the code that adds interface information to the
          meta type registry.

        - Collector #2274: fixed typo in Transaction.py. Made Connection.py
          a bit more noisy in case of failure

        - Collector #2273: fixed bug in STXNG (unable to handle :img: 
          commands with absolute URLs)

        - Collector #2272: fixed problem in Transaction.py (Objects
          with id==None could not print themselves)

        - fixed Python module import problems causing XML export/import
          too be completely broken
    
        - Collector #2270: fixed import problem when $INSTANCE_HOME  
          was set

        - Collector #2269: default script for PythonScript is no longer
          compiled during installation

        - Updated to zlib 1.1.3.

        - fixed parenthesis handling for TextIndex queries

        - Collector #2283: PersistentMapping class keys() method now returns
          a *copy* of the cached keys list instead of the cached list of
          keys itself.  This prevents mutation of the list.

        - DateTime constructor now accepts ISO 8601 compliant dates

        - Collector #2254: added hook for webdav/ftp MKCOL

        - Collector #2247: put values of properties into CDATA section  to 
          prevent non XML compliant documents to be sent to a webdav client.

        - Collector #2287: fixed missing import of 'render_blocks' in 
          SendMailTag.py

    Zope 2.4 alpha 1

      Features Added

        - Zope now requires Python 2.1. See the Zope 2.4 migration 
          document for details:

          http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope/2.4.0/Zope24MigrationGuide.html

        - The 'Authenticated' role has been added as one of Zope's
          standard roles.  A user's possession of this role indicates
          that he or she has been authenticated by the Zope security
          machinery.  It is an implicit role, and cannot be provided to
          users within the user management screens or the local roles
          management screens.  It is provided to all authenticated users.
          Another way to think of the 'Authenticated' role is that
          it is possessed by all users *except* the Anonymous User.

        - A module 'requestprofiler.py' is now part of the utilities
          directory.  When run from the command line, this utility
          allows you to generate profiling information from Zope's
          detailed request log (the "-M" log).

        - Restricted code can import AccessControl.getSecurityManager,
          and use 'validate', 'validateValue', 'checkPermission',
          'getUser', and 'calledByExecutable'.

        - Zope's WebDAV support now includes exclusive write locking.

        - Data.fs.in index_html now shows zope_quick_start instead
          of old, inaccurate content.

        - Changed index_html, standard_html_header, standard_html_footer,
          and standard_error_message in Data.fs.in to use "new" DTML syntax
          (as opposed to SSI-style syntax).

        - Added check for 'FORCE_PRODUCT_LOAD' environ var to bits which
          try to detect whether we're a ZEO client or not in order not to
          skip product-loading tasks.  This has the consequence that a ZEO
          client with the "ZEO_CLIENT" env var set will cause product
          loading tasks to occur iff his "FORCE_PRODUCT_LOAD" environment
          var is set as well.

        - Further optimizations in the lexicon of the Catalog as well
          as the final merge code integration for Text indexes.  This
          should reduce the bloat when things are reindexed.  

        - StructuredText: old StructuredText replaces by StructuredTextNG.
          Added support for locale settings.  Several bugfixes and code
          cleanup.

        - Image and File objects now support the HTTP Range and If-Range
          headers, enabeling partial downloads of such objects. This can be
          used by clients to restart a broken download. Downloads of these
          objects through FTP can also be restarted.

        - Update of Medusa tree to latest version

        - If an INSTANCE_HOME is defined and has a 'lib/python'
          subdirectory, it will be added to the front of the Python path.

        - DTML-In and DTML-Tree now have optional "prefix" attributes
          that can be used to make friendlier tag variable names.

        - Added product reloading capability, formerly provided by
          the "Refresh" product.  This enables developers to see the
          effect of changes to their products without restarting Zope.

        - Added new 'sequence' module for underscore namespace to provide
          extended sorting functionality for sequence (implements
          ExtendedDTMLSorting proposal)

        - Fixed a long-standing bug in FileStorage that made it so
          versions were only partially committed.

        - Rewrote the complete indexing infrastructure according
          to the DropinIndex proposal
          (see lib/python/Products/PlugginIndexes/README.txt for 
          detailed informations). 

        - Adopted ZCatalog to new indexing infrastructure. 
                                  
        - added text() method to HTTPRequest object to provide a plain 
          text representation of the request (Collector #2264)
        
            

    Zope 2.3.0 beta 3

      Features Added

        - Make ZClasses navigable to FTP/WebDAV; implement 'PUT_factory'
          hook to create PythonScripts (for MIMEtype 'text/x-python')
          and DTMLMethods (for other 'text' MIMEtypes) (Collector #998).

      Bugs Fixed

        - Mechanisms in the underbelly of the Catalog and Globbing
          Lexicon (which is the default for all new Catalogs) has been
          overhauled given substantial performance increases.  On
          simple queries, performance should double (or more) in many
          situations, whereas with globbed queries it may increase by
          substantially more.

    Zope 2.3.0 beta 1

      Features Added

        - Added a hook that allows user folders to provide a logout
          action.

        - Added a browser preferences screen to allow people to 
          tweak the management UI to their liking. For the folks who 
          complained that they didn't like the new top frame, they 
          can (among other things) turn it off from the browser 
          preferences screen.

        - Added Michel's new QuickStart material. I haven't quite 
          decided whether the old QuickStart should go away or 
          stay around as a source of examples.

        - The logout function has been implemented in a fairly minimal 
          way. We may try to make this nicer by final if we get time.

        - The ZCatalog interface is now cleaned up and matches the new 
          interface look and feel better. In addition some logical
          reorganization was made to move things onto an Advanced tab.

        - Result sets from the Catalog are now much Lazier, and will
          do concatenation with eachother in a lazy fashion.  This was
          suggested by Casey Duncan in Collector #1712.

      Bugs Fixed

        - Added a deprecated alias to UnrestrictedUser, Super, for use
          by user folder products that depend on the old class name.

        - Fixed path for management interface files used for
          CatalogPathAwareness and Aqueduct.

        - Fixed a NameError in HTTPRequest.

        - Made manage_page_style.css correctly available to all.

        - ZCatalog objects now show up in the Add List in the same
          naming convention that was used for all other Z* objects.
          This does *not* affect the meta_type that is actually used
          for the object itself.

        - (Collector #1835, 1820, 1826) Eliminated errors in both
          Field and Keyword indexes where old keys might show up in
          'uniqueValuesFor()' because of the way the data structures
          were kept around.

        - (Collector #1823)Eliminated situation where if the Catalog
          did not have a metadata record for 'meta_type' the Cataloged
          Objects view would be incorrect and list everything as a
          'ZCatalog'. Now it simply lists it as 'Unknown'.

        - (Collector #1844) On the brains returned from ZCatalog
          queries, 'getObject()' now tries to resolve URLs as well as
          paths.  This should catch more cases.

        - Tags generated for ImageFile objects attempted to use 
          title_or_id(), which is not defined for those objects.

        - Mounting now fails gracefully in when getId() is not
          available in the mounted object.

    Zope 2.3.0 alpha 2

      Features Added

        - The install machinery for source release has been modified 
          to allow Zope to build out of the box for Python 2.0. Note 
          however, that Python 2.0 is still not officially supported. 
          You may see quite a few warnings from the extension builder 
          when compiling for Python 2.

        - A new module, AccessControl.Permissions has been added to 
          make it easier to use the new security assertion spelling. 
          The new module provides consistent symbolic constants for 
          the standard Zope permissions.

        - Cache manager support added.  This allows site administrators
          to ease the burden on their site in a very configurable
          way.  It also provides an API for developers to follow when
          experimenting with caching strategies.

        - The ZPublisher 'method' form variable type has been 
          deprecated in favor of 'action'. The behavior is the 
          same, only the official (and documented in the Zope
          book) name has changed. The 'method' name is still 
          supported for backward compatibility.

        - The 'objectIds' and 'objectValues' methods of ObjectManager
          derived objects are no longer directly Web-accessible. This 
          is a topic that has come up over and over on the lists. Some 
          (xml-rpc, mostly) users may depend on this behavior - applications
          that need access to this information remotely should be modified 
          so that a Python Script or DTML Method can explicitly pass 
          the data. 
          
        - The Image.tag() and ZopeAttributionButton methods now return an
          image tag that is XHTML compatible; a space and a slash have been
          added.

        - SQLMethods can now be edited via FTP and WebDAV tools. Thanks to 
          Anthony Baxter for his FTP support patches.

        - The Catalog has been slightly overhauled to manage object
          paths instead of URLs in its tables.  This should not cause
          any backward compatability concern, but everyone upgrading
          should read the web pages on the zope.org site at:
          http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZCatalogVirtualHostFix/UpgradeFAQ
          this will provide information about how to upgrade and new
          features on the result sets, like getObject and
          getPath. These are very important.
     
        - SiteAccess 2.0 has been added, to enable virtual hosting.

        - The StandardCacheManagers product has been added as a primary
          product, making it easier to get started with caching.

        - The class DTMLFile has been added alongside of HTMLFile.
          It supports name bindings, ignores positional parameters,
          and puts the container on top of the namespace by default.
          Most HTMLFiles should work the same (or more securely) if
          converted to a DTMLFile.  Most management interface methods
          should be converted by the final release of 2.3.

        - Added a variable called PUBLISHED to REQUEST.  From now on,
          this variable should be used instead of PARENTS for user
          validation.

        - The inituser file is now read even when one user has been
          created.  This provides a way to reset the password after
          a new user installs Zope but ignores the generated password.

        - ZCatalogs have a reduced number of management interface tabs.

        - ZCatalog keyword and field indexes have been modified to use
          a merge strategy when existing indexes are updated.  When an
          existing object is indexed, the contents of field and
          keyword indexes are merged with the changes detected between
          the existing contents of the index and the new content.

        - CatalogPathAware class added.  This will eventually replace
          CatalogAware.

        - The ManagementInterfaceQuickFix project was merged in. The 
          Zope management interface has been tweaked in various ways 
          to improve productivity and consistency and is now at least 
          slightly less ugly :)

=======
>>>>>>> 1.310
      Bugs Fixed

        - TextIndexes which called methods expecting an argument failed
          with a TypeError.  This was fixed by extending an exception
          handler.

        - A security issue having to do with setting permission mappings
          on ZClass methods was fixed (this supersedes Hotfix-2001-05-01)

        - Automatic reloading of Help topics while running in debug mode
          was fixed.

        - Fixed problem adding propertynames with spaces (Collector #2206)

        - Plugged a memory leak in extensions.  There are often circular
          references in code generated by Python's "exec" statement but
          with a small change extensions now break those references.

        - Hardened ZMI contents view against subobjects w/ flaky
          'get_size' (Collector #1900).

        - Fixed OFS.CopySupport's _verifyObjectPaste to utilize the
          permission stored in the metatype registry, if available
          (Collector #1975)

        - Fixed a long-standing bug in FileStorage that made it so
          versions were only partially committed.
