Zope Changes

  This file contains change information for the current Zope release.
  Change information for previous versions of Zope can be found in the
  file HISTORY.txt.


  Trunk (unreleased)

    Restructuring

      - Updated to ZODB 3.9.0a10. ZODB-level version support has been
        removed and ZopeUndo now is part of Zope2.

      - The Zope2 SVN trunk is now a buildout pulling in all dependencies as
        actual released packages and not SVN externals anymore.

      - Make use of the new zope.container and zope.site packages.

      - Updated to newer versions of zope packages. Removed long deprecated
        layer and skin ZCML directives.

      - Disabled the XML export on the UI level - the export functionality
        however is still available on the Python level.

      - No longer show the Help! links in the ZMI, if there is no help
        available. The help system depends on the product registry.

      - Updated the quick start page and simplified the standard content.
        The default index_html is now a page template.

      - Removed deprecated Draft and Version support from Products.OFSP.
        Also removed version handling from the control panel. Versions are
        no longer supported on the ZODB level.

      - Removed left-overs of the deprecated persistent product distribution
        mechanism.

      - The persistent product registry is not required for starting Zope
        anymore. `enable-product-installation` can be set to off if you don't
        rely on the functionality provided by the registry.

      - ZClasses have been deprecated for two major releases. They have been
        removed in this version of Zope.

      - Avoid deprecation warnings for the md5 and sha modules in Python 2.6
        by adding conditional imports for the hashlib module.

      - Replaced  imports from the 'Globals' module throughout the 
        tree with imports from the actual modules;  the 'Globals' module
        was always intended to be an area for shared data, rather than
        a "facade" for imports.  Added zope.deferred.deprecation entries
        to 'Globals' for all symbols / modules previously imported directly.

      - Updated 'pytz' from '2007f' to '2008i'.

      - Moved svn:externals for 'mechanize', 'ClientPath', and 'pytz' to
        versions managed outside the Zope3 trunk.

      - Protect against non-existing zope.conf path and products directories.
        This makes it possible to run a Zope instance without a Products or
        lib/python directory.

      - updated to ZODB 3.8.1

      - Moved exception MountedStorageError from ZODB.POSExceptions
        to Products.TemporaryFolder.mount (now its only client).

      - LP #253362:  Moved Zope2-specific module, ZODB/Mount.py, to
        Products/TemporaryFolder/mount.py (its only client is
        Products/TemporaryFolder/TemporaryFolder.py).

      - Removed spurious import-time dependencies from
        Products/ZODBMountPoint/MountedObject.py.

      - Removed Examples.zexp from the skeleton. The TTW shopping cart isn't
        any good example of Zope usage anymore.

      - Removed deprecated ZTUtil.Iterator module

      - Removed deprecated StructuredText module

      - Removed deprecated TAL module

      - Removed deprecated modules from Products.PageTemplates.

      - Removed deprecated ZCML directives from Five including the whole
        Five.site subpackage.

      - Turned deprecation warnings for manage_afterAdd, manage_beforeDelete
        and manage_afterClone methods into discouraged warnings. These methods
        will not be removed in Zope 2.11, but stay for the foreseeable future.
        Using events is still highly encouraged.

      - Moved two implements declarations from Five into the proper classes.

      - Document.sequence: replaced by zope.sequencesort

      - All Products folders as well as the zope and zope.app folders are
        declared as setuptools namespace packages now. See
        http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools#namespace-packages
        for more information about namespace packages.

      - ZPT: removed display of ZPT warnings since warnings were
        removed from the zope.pagetemplate implementation     

      - Ship Zope with a standard docutils 0.4 distribution, instead
        of a patched one.  Both trusted and untrusted code are still
        protected against unwanted file inclusion.

      - Removed ZGadflyDA (was deprecated since Zope 2.9). The code is
        still available from svn.zope.org/Products.ZGadflyDA.

      - Removed OFS.content_types (was deprecated since Zope 2.9)

      - Undeprecated 'zLOG', which will remain a backward-compatibility
        shim for the Python logging module.

      - Indexes: Removed unused parameters from '_apply_index' methods.

      - Fixed Collector #2190: Calls to
        zope.security.management.checkPermission aren't rerouted to
        Zope 2's security policy.

        NOTE: If you already have a Zope 2.10 instance running, you
        will either have to recreate it or add the following lines to
        the end of the etc/site.zcml file::

          <securityPolicy
                component="Products.Five.security.FiveSecurityPolicy" />

      - Fixed Collector #2223: Evaluation of booleans in TALES and the
        'default' variable.

      - Removed deprecated support for product initialization based on
        '__ac_permissions__' and 'meta_types' attributes.

      - Collector #2213: Can't edit "old" ZopePageTemplate instances.

      - Collector #2235: A number of ZCatalog methods were doing boolean
        evaluation of objects that implemented __len__ instead of checking
        them against None. Replaced a number of "if not obj" with
        "if obj is None".

      - reStructuredText/ZReST: setting raw_enabled to 0 for security
        reasons

      - Collector #2113:  'zopectl test' masked Ctrl-C.

      - OFS Image: Image and File updated to use isinstance(data, str)
        and raises TypeError upon encountering unicode objects.

      - OFS Application: Updated deprecation warnings.
        Support for '__ac_permissions__' and 'meta_types' will be removed in
        Zope 2.11, 'methods' support might remain longer.

    Features added

      - Acquisition has been made aware of __parent__ pointers. This allows
        direct access to many Zope 3 classes without the need to mixin
        Acquisition base classes for the security to work.

      - Zope2 startup: Zope will now send DatabaseOpened and
        ProcessStarting events.

      - Testing.ZopeTestCase: Introduced a "ZopeLite" test layer, making it
        possible to mix ZTC and non-ZTC tests much more freely.

      - Testing/custom_zodb.py: added support use a different storage other
        than DemoStorage. A dedicated FileStorage can be mount by setting
        the $TEST_FILESTORAGE environment variable to a custom Data.fs
        file.  A ZEO server can be configured using the $TEST_ZEO_HOST and
        $TEST_ZEO_PORT environment variables. This new functionality allows
        us to use the standard Zope testrunner for writing and running
        tests against existing Zope installations.

      - The ZPublisher HTTP request has now both the debug and locale
        attributes available, like its Zope 3 counterpart. The debug
        attribute was so far limited to code from the zope.* namespace in
        order to make the Zope 3 ZPT engine work. The locale attribute
        provides access to an zope.i18n.interfaces.locales.ILocale object
        with access to locale related information like date / time
        formatting or translated language and country names. Form variables
        of both debug and locale will shadow these two attributes and their
        use is therefor discouraged.

      - MailHost: now uses zope.sendmail for delivering the mail. With this
        change MailHost integrates with the Zope transaction system (avoids
        sending dupe emails in case of conflict errors). In addition
        MailHost now provides support for asynchronous mail delivery. The
        'Use queue' configuration option will create a mail queue on the
        filesystem (under 'Queue directory') and start a queue thread that
        checks the queue every three seconds. This decouples the sending of
        mail from its delivery.  In addition MailHosts now supports
        encrypted connections through TLS/SSL.

      - integrated ZODB 3.8
    
      - integrated Zope 3.4

      - Support for using zopectl on Windows has been added. All commands are
        supported and there are two Windows specific ones: install and remove,
        which install or remove the Windows service. The start, stop and
        restart commands handle the Windows service. In order to use them, you
        need to call 'bin\zopectl install' once.

      - ZCatalog result objects (catalog brains) now have an interface,
        ZCatalog.interfaces.ICatalogBrain.

      - A new module, AccessControl.requestmethod, provides a decorator
        factory that limits decorated methods to one request method only.
        For example, marking a method with @requestmethod('POST') limits
        that method to POST requests only when published. Several
        security-related methods have been limited to POST only.

      - PythonScripts: allow usage of Python's 'sets' module

      - added 'fast_listen' directive to http-server and
        webdav-source-server sections in etc/zope.conf in order to defer
        the opening of the sockets until the late startup phase. This in in
        particular useful when running Zope behind a loadbalancer (patch by
        Patrick Gerken).

      - the ZopePageTemplate implementation now uses unicode internally.
        Non-unicode instances are migrated on-the-fly to unicode. However
        this will work only properly for ZPT instances formerly encoded as
        utf-8 or ISO-8859-15. For other encodings you might set the
        environment variable ZPT_REFERRED_ENCODING to insert your preferred
        encoding in front of utf-8 and ISO-8859-15 within the encoding
        sniffer code.

        In addition there is a new 'output_encodings' property that controls
        the conversion from/to unicode for WebDAV/FTP operations.

      - the ZPT implementation has now a configurable option in order how
        to deal with UnicodeDecodeErrors. A custom
        UnicodeEncodingConflictResolver can be configured through ZCML (see
        Products/PageTemplates/(configure.zcml, unicodeconflictresolver.py,
        interfaces.py)

      - AccessControl.Role: added new method
        manage_getUserRolesAndPermissions().

      - AccessControl: the form behind the "Security" tab has a new form
        for user-related reporting of permissions and roles

      - Zope 3-based exception views can now be registered in ZCML for
        various exceptions that can be raised by Zope. Registering an
        exception view can be done like this:

          <browser:page
            for="zope.publisher.interfaces.INotFound"
            class=".view.SomeView"
            name="index.html"
            permission="zope.Public" />

        Relevant exceptions that can have views are:

        zope.interface.common.interfaces.IException
        zope.publisher.interfaces.INotFound
        zope.security.interfaces.IForbidden
        zope.security.interfaces.IUnauthorized

        Note that the name has to be 'index.html' for the exception
        view to work. (patch by Sidnei da Silva from Enfold,
        integration by Martijn Faassen (Startifact) for Infrae)

      - DateTime now uses pytz for time zone data. This means support
        for more time zones and up to date daylight saving time
        information.

    Bugs Fixed

      - Specified height/width of icons in ZMI listings so the table doesn't
        jump around while loading.

      - Acquisition wrappers now correctly proxy __iter__.

      - Launchpad #174705:  ensure that the error info object exposed to a
        'tal:on_error' handler has attributes visible to restricted code.

      - After the proper introduction of parent-pointers, it's now
        wrong to acquisition-wrap content providers. We will now use
        the "classic" content provider expression from Zope 3.
    
      - Testing.ZopeTestCase: Remove quota argument from DemoStorage calls in
        preparation for ZODB 3.9.

      - Ported c69896 to Five. This fix makes it possible to provide a
        template using Python, and not have it being set to `None` by
        the viewlet manager directive.
    
      - Made Five.testbrowser compatible with mechanize 0.1.7b.

      - Ensure that response header values cannot embed CRLF pairs, which
        violate the HTTP spec (RFC 2616).

      - Testing.ZopeTestCase: installPackage was tied to the ZopeLite layer.

      - Launchpad #280334: Fixed problem with 'timeout'
        argument/attribute missing in testbrowser tests.

      - Launchpad #282677: fixed implementation of guarded_map and
        provided tests and implementation for guarded_zip (RestrictedPython).

      - Lauchpad #143736,#271395: fixed AttributeError' on _ltid in TempStorage

      - 'AccessControl.ZopeGuards.guarded_import' mapped some Unauthorized
        exceptions onto ImportErrors:  don't do that!  Also, removed
        mutable defaults from argument list, improved tests.

      - LP #281156:  'AccessControl.SecurityInfo.secureModule' dropped
        ModuleSecurity for failed imports, obscuring later attempts to
        import the same broken module.

      - Launchpad #267834: proper separation of HTTP header fields   
        using CRLF as requested by RFC 2616.

      - Launchpad #267545: DateTime(DateTime()) now preserves the
        correct hour

      - Launchpad #262313: respect the 'Expand macros when editing' flag
        when editing a page template through the ZMI

      - Launchpad #257276: fix for possible denial-of-service attack
        in PythonScript when passing an arbitrary module to the encode()
        or decode() of strings.

      - Launchpad #257269: 'raise SystemExit' with a PythonScript could shutdown
        a complete Zope instance

      - DateTime conversion of datetime objects with non-pytz tzinfo. 
        Timezones() returns a copy of the timezone list (allows tests to run).

      - LP #253362: better dealing with malformed HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET headers

      - Launchpad #246748: added 'immediate' option to sendXXX() methods
        for sending a mail immediately by-passing the zope.sendmail delivery
        mechanism

      - Launchpad #246290: fixed backward compatibility issue

      - Launchpad #245649:  the Products package is now a proper
        "namespace package" under the rules specified by setuptools.

      - fixed outdated transaction.commit(1) call in 
        ZODBMountPoint.SimpleTrailblazer

      - Fixed against-the-rules zope.conf option 'fast_listen' to read
        'fast-listen' (dash, not underscore).

      - Switch to branch of 'zope.testbrowser' external which suppresses
        over-the-wire tests.

      - Launchpad #164783: Indexes were migrated on initial creation of a
        ZODB.

      - Launchpad #151020: HTTP_CHAR_SET headers containing 'x-user-defined'
        caused a LookupError exception. Unknown encodings are from now on
        silently discarded.

      - Launchpad #143902: Fixed App.ImageFile to use a stream iterator to
        output the file. Avoid loading the file content when guessing the
        mimetype and only load the first 1024 bytes of the file when it cannot
        be guessed from the filename.

      - Changed PageTemplateFile not to load the file contents on Zope startup
        anymore but on first access instead. This brings them inline with the
        zope.pagetemplate version and speeds up Zope startup.

      - Launchpad #147201: treat container-class in zope.conf as a string,
        making it possible to use types from extra products directories.

      - Collector #2278: form ':record' objects did not implement enough
        of the mapping protocol.

      - Collector #2352: fix in OFS.Traversable

      - Collector #2346: username logging in FCGI crashed the server

      - Collector #2339: ZPT: fixed unicode issue when using the 'structure'
        directive

      - Collector #2332: SessionDataManger: don't swallow ConflictErrors

      - ZopePageTemplate's pt_edit did not recognize content type arguments
        which had a charset information included.

      - "version.txt" file was being written to the wrong place by the
        Makefile, causing Zope to report "unreleased version" even for
        released versions.

      - Collector #1306: Missing acquisition context on local roles screen.

      - Collector #2153: Supporting unquoted cookies with spaces.

      - The REQUEST no longer accepts holds after it has been closed.

      - Five.browser.metaconfigure.page didn't protect names from interface
        superclasses (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/2333)

      - Fixed bug in ZPublisher.BaseRequest with persistent site managers.
        An EndRequestEvent was thrown after the ZODB connection was already
        closed and thus the site manager not being available anymore.

      - Collector #2295: Comments in PythonScripts could lead to syntax
        errors

      - Collector #1441: WebDAV compatibility with Windows Web Folders
        restored by adding a configuration variable that controls the
        sending of the non-standard MS-Author-Via and Public
        headers. Thanks for PatrickD for the the hard work coming up
        with an initial patch.  
        (http://zope.org/Collectors/Zope/1441)

      - DAV: litmus "notowner_modify" tests warn during a MOVE request
        because we returned "412 Precondition Failed" instead of "423
        Locked" when the resource attempting to be moved was itself
        locked.  Fixed by changing Resource.Resource.MOVE to raise the
        correct error.

      - DAV: litmus props tests 19: propvalnspace and 20:
        propwformed were failing because Zope did not strip off the
        xmlns: attribute attached to XML property values.  We now strip
        off all attributes that look like xmlns declarations.

      - DAV: When a client attempted to unlock a resource with a token
        that the resource hadn't been locked with, in the past we
        returned a 204 response.  This was incorrect.  The "correct"
        behavior is to do what mod_dav does, which is return a '400
        Bad Request' error.  This was caught by litmus
        locks.notowner_lock test #10.  See
        http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2001JanMar/0099.html
        for further rationale.

      - When Zope properties were set via DAV in the "null" namespace
        (xmlns="") a subsequent PROPFIND for the property would cause the
        XML representation for that property to show a namespace of
        xmlns="None".  Fixed within OFS.PropertySheets.dav__propstat.

      - integrated theuni's additional test from 2.11 (see r73132)

      - Relaxed requirements for context of
        Products.Five.browser.pagetemplatefile.ZopeTwoPageTemplateFile,
        to reduce barriers for testing renderability of views which
        use them.
        (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/2327)

      - Collector #2304: fixed markup issue in ptEdit.zpt

      - Collector #2260: fixed bug in Examples package

      - Collector #2320: HTTPResponse setHeader lowercased keys but getHeader
        did not, causing lookups of 'Content-Type' to fail

      - Collector #2307: ObjectCopiedEvent not dispatched to sublocations.

      - Collector #2298: webdav.Resource.COPY and webdav.Resource.MOVE did
        not send the expected copy/move events.

      - Collector #2296: Fixed import of ZClass products, broken by removal
        of BBB support for pasting objects whose meta_type info was
        permission-free.

      - Collector #2294: Protected DOS-able ControlPanel methods with the
        same 'requestmethod' wrapper.

      - Collector #2294: Protected various security mutators with a new
        'postonly' decorator.  The decorator limits method publishing to
        POST requests only, and is a backport from Zope 2.11's requestmethod
        decorator factory.

      - Collector #2289: restored compatiblity with PTProfiler

      - No longer opens a zodb connection every time a ProductDispatcher
        is looked up.

      - PageTemplate/ZRPythonExpr.py: expressions represented as unicode
        string caused UnicodeDecodeErrors.

      - PluginIndexes: Fixed 'parseIndexRequest' for false values.

      - Collector #2269: fixed broken ZPT FTP support

      - Collector #2261: Acquisition when creating objects via Webdav.

        to the ISO8601 specification.

      - Reworking of _cached_result in Shared.DC.ZRDB.DA.DA:

        - fixed KeyError reported in Collector #2212

        - fixed two memory leaks that occurred under high load

        - fixed broken cache keys for people using the obscure
          Shared.DC.ZRDB.DA.DA.connection_hook

        - fixed incorrect cache ordering resulting in newer results
          being dumped when the cache became too large.

      - Collector #2237: 'make' doesn't tell you to run 'make inplace'
        before running 'make instance'.

      - Collector #2232: Can't call DTML templates from Page Templates

      - Collector #2198: Zope 3.3 fix breaks Five 1.5 test_getNextUtility

      - Collector #2206: Set PYTHONPATH to include existing PYTHONPATH
        in skel/bin/zopectl.in and skel/bin/runzope.in

      - Collector #2209: ZTUtils module could not be used inside ZPT

      - Collector #2208: rewriting/setting the  ``charset`` part of the

      - Call setDefaultSkin on new requests created as the result of
        ConflictError retries.

      - Collector #2155: Fix wrong parameter being passed to
        logger's error() method, with tests.

      - Collector #2157: Expose name of broken class in SystemError raised
        from '__getstate__' of a broken instance.

      - Usage of 'urljoin' in 'webdav.davcmds' could lead to wrongly
        constructed urls.

      - reStructuredText/ZReST: setting raw_enabled to 0 for security
        reasons

      - Collector #2113: 'zopectl test' masked Ctrl-C.

      - OFS Image: Image and File updated to use isinstance(data, str)
        and raises TypeError upon encountering unicode objects.

      - Collector #2122: fixed missing is_proxying_match definition
        in ZServer/HTTPServer

      - Collector #2077: fixed problem with ACTUAL_URL and SiteRoot

      - Collector #2073: fixed misbehaviour of OFS.Owned.changeOwnership

      - Collector #2063: cleaned up some mess in MailHost.sendTemplate()

      - View and attribute lookup order was changed to the following::
           1. Unacquired attributes
           2. Views
           3. Acquired attributes

        According to consensus in z3-five mailing list:

      - The defaultView directive now only looks up views, not attributes.

      - Collector #2187: PUT_factory broken (fwd port from 2.10 branch).

      - Prevent ZPublisher from insering incorrect <base/> tags into the
        headers of plain html files served from Zope3 resource directories.
      
      - Changed the condition checking for setting status of
        HTTPResponse from to account for new-style classes.
      
      - The Wrapper_compare function from tp_compare to tp_richcompare.
        Also another function Wrapper_richcompare is added.
      
      - The doc test has been slightly changed in ZPublisher to get
        the error message extracted correctly.

      - The changes made in Acquisition.c in Implicit Acquisition
        comparison made avail to Explicit Acquisition comparison also.

      - zopedoctest no longer breaks if the URL contains more than one
        question mark. It broke even when the second question mark was
        correctly quoted.

    Other Changes

      - Disabled docutils file inclusion completely, rather than trying
        to jigger it via configuration settings.

      - Returned to the "classic" './configure && make && make install'
        recipe, dropping the use of 'zpkg' for building Zope2 releases.

      - Added lib/python/webdav/litmus-results.txt explaining current
        test results from the litmus WebDAV torture test.

      - DocumentTemplate.DT_Var.newline_to_br(): Simpler, faster implementation.
