    Zope 2.4 alpha 1

      Features Added

        - Zope now requires Python 2.1. See the Zope 2.4 migration 
          document for details:

          http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope/2.4.0/Zope24MigrationGuide.html

        - The 'Authenticated' role has been added as one of Zope's
          standard roles.  A user's possession of this role indicates
          that he or she has been authenticated by the Zope security
          machinery.  It is an implicit role, and cannot be provided to
          users within the user management screens or the local roles
          management screens.  It is provided to all authenticated users.
          Another way to think of the 'Authenticated' role is that
          it is possessed by all users *except* the Anonymous User.

        - A module 'requestprofiler.py' is now part of the utilities
          directory.  When run from the command line, this utility
          allows you to generate profiling information from Zope's
          detailed request log (the "-M" log).

        - Restricted code can import AccessControl.getSecurityManager,
          and use 'validate', 'validateValue', 'checkPermission',
          'getUser', and 'calledByExecutable'.

        - Zope's WebDAV support now includes exclusive write locking.

        - Data.fs.in index_html now shows zope_quick_start instead
          of old, inaccurate content.

        - Changed index_html, standard_html_header, standard_html_footer,
          and standard_error_message in Data.fs.in to use "new" DTML syntax
          (as opposed to SSI-style syntax).

        - Added check for 'FORCE_PRODUCT_LOAD' environ var to bits which
          try to detect whether we're a ZEO client or not in order not to
          skip product-loading tasks.  This has the consequence that a ZEO
          client with the "ZEO_CLIENT" env var set will cause product
          loading tasks to occur iff his "FORCE_PRODUCT_LOAD" environment
          var is set as well.

        - Further optimizations in the lexicon of the Catalog as well
          as the final merge code integration for Text indexes.  This
          should reduce the bloat when things are reindexed.  

        - StructuredText: old StructuredText replaces by StructuredTextNG.
          Added support for locale settings.  Several bugfixes and code
          cleanup.

        - Image and File objects now support the HTTP Range and If-Range
          headers, enabeling partial downloads of such objects. This can be
          used by clients to restart a broken download. Downloads of these
          objects through FTP can also be restarted.

        - Update of Medusa tree to latest version

        - If an INSTANCE_HOME is defined and has a 'lib/python'
          subdirectory, it will be added to the front of the Python path.

        - DTML-In and DTML-Tree now have optional "prefix" attributes
          that can be used to make friendlier tag variable names.

        - Added product reloading capability, formerly provided by
          the "Refresh" product.  This enables developers to see the
          effect of changes to their products without restarting Zope.

        - Added new 'sequence' module for underscore namespace to provide
          extended sorting functionality for sequence (implements
          ExtendedDTMLSorting proposal)

      Bugs Fixed

        - TextIndexes which called methods expecting an argument failed
          with a TypeError.  This was fixed by extending an exception
          handler.

        - A security issue having to do with setting permission mappings
          on ZClass methods was fixed (this supersedes Hotfix-2001-05-01)

        - Automatic reloading of Help topics while running in debug mode
          was fixed.

        - Fixed problem adding propertynames with spaces (Collector #2206)

        - Plugged a memory leak in extensions.  There are often circular
          references in code generated by Python's "exec" statement but
          with a small change extensions now break those references.

        - Hardened ZMI contents view against subobjects w/ flaky
          'get_size' (Collector #1900).

        - Fixed OFS.CopySupport's _verifyObjectPaste to utilize the
          permission stored in the metatype registry, if available
          (Collector #1975)

        - Fixed a long-standing bug in FileStorage that made it so
          versions were only partially committed.
