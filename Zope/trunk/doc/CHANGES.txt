Zope Changes

  This file contains change information for the current Zope release.
  Change information for previous versions of Zope can be found in the
  file HISTORY.txt.

  To-do

   - Add cyclic-garbage collection support to C extension classes,
     especially to acquisition wrappers.

     N.B:  ExtensionClassType already declares that it supports GC
     (via the Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC flag), but does not appear to conform
     to the rules for such a type laid out in the Python docs:
     http://docs.python.org/api/supporting-cycle-detection.html

  Trunk  (unreleased)

    Restructuring

      - Removed deprecated support for product initialization based on
        '__ac_permissions__' and 'meta_types' attributes.

      - removed zLOG module which was deprecated since Zope 2.9

    Features added

    Bugs Fixed

      - reStructuredText/ZReST: setting raw_enabled to 0 for security
        reasons

      - Collector #2113: 'zopectl test' masked Ctrl-C.

      - OFS Image: Image and File updated to use isinstance(data, str)
        and raises TypeError upon encountering unicode objects.

      - Collector #2122: fixed missing is_proxying_match definition
        in ZServer/HTTPServer

      - Collector #2077: fixed problem with ACTUAL_URL and SiteRoot

      - Collector #2063: cleaned up some mess in MailHost.sendTemplate()

      - View and attribute lookup order was changed to the following:
           1. Unacquired attributes
           2. Views
           3. Acquired attributes
        According to consensus in z3-five mailing list:
        http://codespeak.net/pipermail/z3-five/2006q2/001474.html
        
      - The defaultView directive now only looks up views, not attributes.
