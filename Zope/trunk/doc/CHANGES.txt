Zope Changes

  This file contains change information for the current Zope release.
  Change information for previous versions of Zope can be found in the
  file HISTORY.txt.

  HEAD only

    Features added

     - ZConfig was updated to version 2.0.  The new version includes
       two new ways to perform schema extension; of particular
       interest in Zope is the ability for a configuration file to
       "import" new schema components to allow 3rd-party components
       (such as storages, databases, or logging handlers) to be used.

    Bugs fixed

     - Collector #721: Entities in tal:attribute values weren't
       properly escaped.

     - Collector #851: Traversable.py: A bare try..except shadowed
       conflict errors

     - Collector #1058: Several fixes for PropertySheets when used
       outside ZClasses

     - Collector #1053: parseIndexRequest turned empty sequence of search
       terms into unrestricted search.

     - manage_tabs had a namespace problem with the acquisition of names from
       the manage_options variable resulting to acquire "target" and "action"
       from objects above in the hierachy.

     - PathIndex and TopicIndex are now using a counter for the number
       of indexed objects instead of using a very expensive calculation
       based on the keys of their indexes. 

     - Collector #1039: Whitespace problem in Z2.log fixed

     - changed some bare try: except:'s in Shared.DC.ZRDB.Connection
       so that they now log exceptions that occur.

  2.7.0b2

    Features added

     - New zopectl feature: adduser.  Instead of using the inituser
       mechanism, "zopectl adduser <name> <password>" will add a user
       with the 'Manager' role to your site.  This is useful both
       interactively and for packagers.

     - New top-level package: nt_svcutils.  This takes the place of
       the Zope.Startup.nt package to allow for reuse outside of Zope.

     - Renamed the "service file" for a Zope instance under Windows
       from ntservice.py to zopeservice.py to allow a ZEO server
       instance to share the same instance home as a Zope instance
       (the ZEO service file will be called zeoservice.py).

     - The TemporaryStorage module was moved from
       Products/TemporaryFolder to a new top-level package named
       tempstorage.

     - Split functionality of mkzopeinstance into two separate
       modules: mkzopeinstance.py and copyzopeskel.py.
       copyzopeskel.py can be used directly by packagers to install
       custom skeleton directories or mkzopeinstance can use a custom
       skeleton directory via the '--skelsrc' flag.

     - Added 'environment' and 'path' directives to config file directive
       list.  'environment' is a section which allows the user to specify
       environment variables within the config file.  'path' allows the
       user to specify additional directories to insert into sys.path
       when configuration is processed.

     - Moved temporary storage related files into their own module
       within lib/python, out of Products.TemporaryStorage.  This was
       necessary in order to prevent the configuration machinery from
       prematurely importing some modules that it didn't need to
       during startup (the transitive set of all imported modules
       within Products.TemporaryStorage).

     - Add a check to the configurator to ensure that the Python found
       has an expat parser.

    Bugs fixed

     - The Products directory in an instance home was not
       automatically added to the Products.__path__ (it needed to be
       specified manually).  It is now automatically added at instance
       startup.

     - The Windows runzope.bat file generated by mkzopeinstance from
       the default skeleton directory now uses python.exe instead of
       pythonw.exe, so you can actually see output from the Zope
       process when you run it interactively.

     - backport of TAL fixes from z3

       * i18n and metal interactions

       * fix handling of nested translations with tal:content/replace 
         and i18n:name

     - Collector #1017: reST has been broken

     - backward compatibility for i18n:attributes

       if items are separated with spaces and there are more than two items,
       all are treated as attributes plus deprecation warning

       if items are separated with spaces and there are two items :

       * i18n:attributes="value msg_id;" (with semicolon) will always be
         treated as <attr> <msg_id>

       * i18n:attributes="value title" will be treated as <attr> <attr> 
         as long as title exist as attribute (both as static or in 
         tal:attributes) plus deprecation warning

     - deny attributes being both part of tal:attributes
       and having a messageid in i18n:attributes

     - Fixed failing Zope.Startup tests caused by import of
       nonexistent Startup.getSchema function.

     - VHM: manage_edit has been broken

     - The container-class keyword to database sections
       didn't work.

     - ZConfig didn't report a line number and munged capitalization
       of replacement keys when a replacement error was provided.

     - log-to-stderr on startup will now emit messages to the console at 
       the lowest logging level defined by any of the handlers in the 
       eventlog section.

     - entirely removed warning when the starting user's umask is "too
       permissive".  it wasn't clear that it added any value under normal
       operations.

     - debug-mode config file option did not work.

     - ZClasses that subclassed ObjectManager that were created in 
       earlier versions of Zope would not load under 2.6, due to 
       the new Interfaces package. Added back a simple stub module 
       and changed a constructor to allow these ZClasses to work.

     - Bugfix: if zopectl is run as the root user, the debug, run, and
       adduser commands will cause the Python process which performs
       those actions to switch users to the effective user.  This
       prevents ZODB index files, log files, etc. from being written
       as root, potentially preventing later startup by the effective
       user.

     - Bugfix: allow the zopectl process to ascertain the program that
       zdrun should run from the Zope config file.  This is necessary
       if the file is moved out of a "single-directory-as-instance"
       instance home.

     - Various fixes to content of ZopeTutorial to deal with URLs moving
       on new.zope.org (thanks to Stefane Fermigier).

     - Added optparse and textwrap modules to docutils package to prevent
       ReST barfage (AJ).

     - Added a sample zeoclient and tempstorage stanzas to the default
       config file (zope.conf.in).

     - Various tweaks to the dbtab configuration code (Shane).

     - Various fixes/enhancements to ZODB/ZEO (PythonLabs).

     - Removed 'inst/Zope.spec' Zope RPM spec file in favor of placing
       it in a separate internal ZC repository.  It will be available
       in the SRPM.

     - Fix for Collector 823 (XML RPC exception values were always
       converted to strings and thus turned into a Fault object).
       Thanks to Sandor Palfy for the patch.

     - Remove --zeo/-z flags from mkzopeinstance.py, as custom_zodb.py
       is no longer the preferred method of configuring custom
       storages now that we have DBTab in the core, and you should be
       able to create a custom skeleton dir with the right
       zope.conf.in that has a zeo client storage set up if you need
       to.

     - 'make sdist' now creates a file with an extension of '.tgz'
       rather than .'.tar.gz' (mainly to meet the expectations of
       Zope.org about file names).

     - moved 'zpasswd.py' into utilities directory in source tree.

  2.7.0b1

    Features added

     - zopectl command now has 'debug' and 'run' options.

     - the zodb_db section in zope.conf now accepts a 'connection-class'
       key that accepts a python dotted-path-name to use as the
       connection class for the database.

     - The ReST input and output encodings are now configured via the
       'rest-input-encoding' and 'rest-output-encoding' config file
       directives rather than the REST_INPUT_ENCODING and
       REST_OUTPUT_ENCODING environment variables.

     - Datetime-format settings are now configured via the
       'datetime-format' configuration file directive rather than the
       DATETIME_FORMAT environment variable.

     - Trusted proxies are now configured via the 'trusted-proxy'
       configuration file directive rather than the
       ZOPE_TRUSTED_PROXIES environment variable.

     - The maximum number of sockets that ZServer will open in order to
       service incoming connections can now be specified via the
       max-listen-sockets conf file parameter.

     - Shane Hathaway's DBTab product has been integrated.  The
       Control_Panel -> Databases tab now allows you to control all
       mounted databases.  You can add a mount point by editing the
       zope.conf file, adding a zodb_db section for the main database
       and other mounted databases, and choosing "ZODB Mount Point"
       from the Zope "Add" list.

     - DTML Methods and Documents supply a traceback supplement when called.

     - Windows installer contains NT/2K/XP service support on
       a per-instance-home basis.

     - zopectl command now has 'debug' and 'run' options.

     - the zodb_db section in zope.conf now accepts a 'connection-class'
       key that accepts a python dotted-path-name to use as the
       connection class for the database.

    Bugs Fixed

     - mkzopeinstance did not expand tildes in directory name input.

     - The 'configure' script did not work under Solaris sh.

     - The SiteErrorLog object did not ignore NotFound errors,
       which caused (mainly) useless messages to be kept in the log.

     - The addition of a linefeed to version.txt in lib/python caused
       Apache proxies to choke because the string was injected into
       a header including the linefeed.  This has been fixed.

     - Collector: #964: standard_error_message refers to looking into the
       HTML code for more information which is deprecated. Referring to
       the error log now.

     - Collector #893: Mailhost: munge_header has been broken for addresses
       containing the recipients full name

     - Zope's setup.py didn't include the ZEO.auth package.

     - Collector #628: Applied patch to fix several textarea resize
       problems.

     - Collector #953: fixed namespace collision with form_title in ZMI

     - Collector #342: Avoiding insertion of a BASE tag for file objects 
       with content-type text/html 

     - Windows installer properly deletes pyc/pyo files on uninstall.

     - Windows binary post-install quickstart page is now more
       informative.

     - Fixed a potential bug in ZTUtils.Tree.decodeExpansion where a
       potentially empty string was tested for it's first character; used
       .startswith for safety.

  2.7.0a1

    Features added

     - OFS: OrderSupport and OrderedFolder added. OrderSupport is a mixin class
       that adds the IOrderedContainer interface to ObjectManagers.
       OrderedFolder - meta_type 'Folder (Ordered)' - is a new Folder class
       using OrderSupport.
       (thanks to Stephan Richter for inspiration and some code)

     - Folder: Constructor now takes an optional 'id' argument.

     - Show known medusa servers in Control_Panel.

     - New startup and installation regime (./configure; make; make install
       instances use a config file, daemon is now a separate process).  See
       http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Proposals/InstallationAndConfiguration
       for more information.

     - New module: App.config.  New API for getting a configuration
       object.  This should be the preferred way for all code in Zope
       to get configured values for many settings.  For settings made
       available via this module, alternate locations are deprecated,
       though will to be supported for Zope 2.7.

     - Collector #435: Support for passwords encoded using MySQL's 
       PASSWORD() function add to lib/python/AccessControl/AuthEncoding.py.

     - Collector #167: Support __getattr__ on cAccessControl PermissionRole
       objects to allow gathering of permission names for products like
       DocFinder and VerboseSecurity.

     - Added a new REQUEST method, getClientAddr(), to determine a clients
       IP address. Address restrictions in the user folder have been changed
       to use this method. By default the value returned by this method is the
       same as the initial value of REQUEST['REMOTE_ADDR']. Zope also has
       support for obtaining a more useful value from other headers if a
       front-end proxy is in use. See doc/ENVIRONMENT.txt for details.

     - DateTime module: added support to parse international dateformats. The
       Datetime constructor has a new "datefmt" parameter to enforce the
       parsing of a date as "us" or "international" date. The new field        
       descriptor field descriptor "date_international" can be used to
       enforce this behaviour inside the ZPublisher. See also 
       doc/ENVIRONMENT.txt to check with the DATETIME_FORMAT 
 
     - KeywordIndex, FieldIndex and ZCTextIndex  are now able to index more
       than one attribute of an object. This removes the ties between the
       indexes ID and the attribute name to be indexed. 

     - Integration of reStructuredText (reST) and the ZReST product
       by Richard Jones.  See doc/RESTRUCTUREDTEXT.txt for details.

     - Objects locked through WebDAV are now marked with a lock icon
       inside the ZMI.

     - Collector #741: Applied patch to provide better FTP error messages.

     - Made all PluginIndexes and ZCTextIndex use 'safe_callable',
       which is aware of extension classes that fill 'tp_callable'
       but don't define '__call__'.

     - Made KeywordIndex be more robust about receiving a value that
       is not a string or an iterable type.

    Bugs Fixed

     - Collector #954: clear() method of TopicIndex removed all filter sets
       instead of clearing them.

     - Collector #939: Fixed typo in TopicIndexes

     - Collector #937: UnicodeError exception available within PythonScripts

     - Collector #902: recursive Scripts were broken due to shared globals.

     - Product initialization would only consult a file named "version.txt"
       to read version information. Now it will check version.txt, VERSION.txt
       and VERSION.TXT.

     - Collector #928: DateIndex ignored timezones when indexing and
       querying

     - Collector #892: misleading error msg when initializing an OIBTree
       from a dict with a float value.  The message claimed that the
       dict's items didn't consist of 2-element tuples, but of course
       they do.  The TypeError now says "expected integer value".

     - Collector #882: delPropertySheet was broken due to a typo

     - Collector #683: WeDAV request without XML preamble
       were not recognized by Zope and raised an exception.

     - Index constructors were called without acquisition context of the
       calling object. This caused caller.getPhysicalPath() to fail for
       indexes depending on this information.

     - Collector #814: PathIndexes now uses IITreeSet instead of
       IISet. This should result in less memory usage.

     - Fixed a whitespace problem in Z2.log (AWStats failed to process
       Zope logfiles)

     - Collector #816: dtml-sendmail corrupted header if message was
       left blank.

     - Collector #790: WebDAV access is granted by default only
       to Managers and Authenticated users instead to Anonymous users.
       This restricts access to the Control_Panel and especially
       to the Products management to trusted users.

     - Rename, Cut & Delete operations on locked objects (WebDAV) are 
       no longer permitted and will raise an exception. Copies of 
       locked objects are copied without lock.

     - Collector #634: Image objects can now be rendered without border
       attribute by calling "image.tag(border='')".

     - Collector #695: Object IDs "." and ".." are no longer permitted.

     - Collector #771: ZCatalog failed to index DTML Document if the name
       of a catalog metadata was identical with the name of an acquired
       object.

     - Collector #686: intSets no longer lose their values.

     - Collector #685: Improved documentation explaining how, where and 
       why security assertions should be placed in:
       lib/python/Products/PythonScripts/README.txt
       lib/python/Products/PythonScripts/module_access_examples.py

     - The ZEO unit tests and wo_pcgi.py didn't run on Windows if the path 
       to the python executable included a space.

     - Some calls to os.system('chmod') has been replaced with the more 
       portable os.chmod() call, to make install work properly on Windows.

     - Fixed an isinstance() check in SimpleItem on standard_error_message
       handling that would always break if the first argument was not
       an extension class because the second argument was a type.

     - Any write request could be tricked into writing into a version
       be setting a version cookie or by including a version name in
       the request.  Now we require the user to globally have
       permission to join or leave versions to run a request in a
       version.

    Backward incompatabilities

      - We no longer honor local security settings that would allow
        someone to join or leave versions unless the location of the
        settings is a folder directly or indirectly containing the
        user's user folder.

    Bugs Fixed

      - Collector #956: automatically installing Examples at startup
        could be a security risk.  Examples now must be installed
        explicitly by the user (thanks to Jamie Heilman and day0).

      - Collector #954: clear() method of TopicIndex removed all filter sets
        instead of clearing them.

      - Collector #882: Fixed typo in PropertySheets

      - Collector #939: Fixed typo in TopicIndexes

      - Collector #937: UnicodeError exception available within PythonScripts

      - Collector #902: recursive Scripts were broken due to shared globals.

      - Product initialization would only consult a file named "version.txt"
        to read version information. Now it will check version.txt, VERSION.txt
        and VERSION.TXT.
    
      - Make ZCTextIndex much less prone to generating conflict errors.
        Previously *any* concurrent updates would provoke a conflict.
        
      - Fix query performance and scalability bug in ZCTextIndex.

      - Collector #928: DateIndex ignored timezones when indexing and
        querying

      - Any write request could be tricked into writing into a version
        be setting a version cookie or by including a version name in
        the request.  Now we require the user to globally have
        permission to join or leave versions to run a request in a
        version.

      - Fixed a problem with potentially mis-acquiring 'func_code' in 
        publisher BeforeTraverse hook.

      - Fix for issue 683: Image cache manager headers were not sent 
        when an image request returned a 304 (in response to an if-mod-since
        request).

      - Made all PluginIndexes and ZCTextIndex use 'safe_callable',
        which is aware of extension classes that fill 'tp_callable'
	but don't define '__call__'.

      - Made KeywordIndex be more robust about receiving a value that
        is not a string or an iterable type.

      - Fixed incorrect docstring in OFSP/Image help.

      - Fixed unhelpful signal description.
