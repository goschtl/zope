      Features Changed

        - Split the old CHANGES.txt into two files. CHANGES.txt will 
          now contain only change information for the current Zope 
          release. Change information for older versions is now in 
          the file HISTORY.txt.

      Bugs Fixed

        - Fixed problem with extra PermissionMapping objects being in
          the aq_parents hierarchy during traversal when a method was
          being accessed a ZClass defined instance method.
