    Zope 2.2.0
    
      Bugs Fixed

        - Fixed Tutorial bug that caused win98 to crash with adding a
          tutorial.

        - Fixed ZService.py to avoid overwriting existing service start 
          parameters at install time on win32.

        - The deprecated alias getSize() was added back to Image and DTML
          objects (existing products still depend on it).

        - Cleaned up a DocumentTemplate namespace issue.  Fixed QuickStart.

        - Removed old validation code in cDocumentTemplate.

	- Minor bug in ZCatalog which prevented deletion of indexes fixed.
