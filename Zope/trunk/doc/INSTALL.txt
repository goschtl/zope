Building and installing Zope

  This document describes building and installing Zope on Unix.
  We will provide Windows instructions in later releases. We
  will also provide binary releases for some platforms.

Building Zope:
  
  There are some python scripts in the top-level directory that should
  help you get started. You must run these scripts from the top-level
  directory.

  If you want to try out Zope in the simplest fashion using a 
  Python web server, then run the script wo_pcgi:

    python wo_pcgi.py

  If you want to use PCGI and an existing web server, run w_pcgi:

    python w_pcgi.py

  Notes:
  
  * You should be using Python 1.5 to run the build scripts.
  * If you just want to use Zope components it's not necessary to build Zope
    but it's a good idea since it will compile Python C extensions for you.
	
Using Zope with ZopeHTTPServer:

  ZopeHTTPServer is a simple web server written in Python and it
  allows you to run Zope without using PCGI and another web server.
  To start Zope using ZopeHTTPServer cd to the Zope directory and
  issue this command:

    python server.py 

Setting the Zope super user name and password: 

  The ZOpe super user has full access to Zope online management
  facilities. Zope defaults to 'superuser' and '123' as the super
  user name and password. You can change this by creating a file
  named 'access' in the Zope directory. The file should contain one
  line that has the user name followed by a colon followed by the
  password. For example:

    mario:nintendoRulez
  
Using Zope with PCGI:

  PCGI is the traditional way of running Zope. PCGI mediates
  between your existing web server and Zope. To use PCGI copy the
  Zope.cgi file to your web server's cgi-bin directory. You can also
  create a symbolic link to Zope.cgi from your cgi-bin directory.
  For example:

    ln -s /home/amos/Zope/Zope.cgi /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/Zope

  If you are using Apache you will need to trick Apache into passing
  authentication headers to Zope. The easiest way to do this is to
  use mod_rewrite. Here is an example of configuration information
  which you would place in an Apache conf file:

    # Zope configuration maps /Zope/ to the Zope.cgi PCGI script
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization}  ^(.*)
    RewriteRule ^/Zope/(.*) /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/Zope.cgi/$1 [e=HTTP_CGI_AUTHORIZATION:%1,t=application/x-httpd-cgi,l]

  Note that the RewriteRule should be one long line.
  
Accessing Zope:
  
  After you either start ZopeHTTPServer or set up PCGI you should be
  able to start using Zope through the web. Point your browser to either
  
  http://localhost:8080/manage
  
  if you are using ZopeHTTPServer or whatever the relevant URL is, if
  you are using PCGI. If you're using PCGI make sure to tack '/manage'
  on after the name of the Zope cgi-script so that you go to the
  management screen.
  
  You will be prompted to enter a user name and a password. Enter the
  user name and password you specified in the access file.
  
  Now your off and running!
  
  If you haven't used Zope before, you should head to the Zope web site
  and read some documentation.

  Have fun!
