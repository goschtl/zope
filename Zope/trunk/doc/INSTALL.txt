Building and installing Zope

  This document describes building and installing Zope on Unix.
  We will provide Windows instructions in later releases. We
  will also provide binary releases for some platforms.

Building Zope:
  
  There are some python scripts in the top-level directory that should
  help you get started. You must run these scripts from the top-level
  directory.

  If you want to try out Zope in the simplest fashion using a 
  Python web server, then run the script wo_pcgi:

    python wo_pcgi.py

  If you want to use PCGI and an existing web server, run w_pcgi:

    python w_pcgi.py

  Notes:
  
  * You should be using Python 1.5.1 to run the build scripts.
  * If you just want to use Zope components it's not necessary to build Zope
    but it's a good idea since it will compile Python C extensions for you.
	
Setting the Zope super user name and password: 

  The Zope super user has full access to Zope online management
  facilities. The super user account is defined by a file named
  'access' in the Zope directory. This file should contain one
  line, which is the super user name followed by a colon followed by 
  the password. For example:

    mario:nintendoRulez

  The build scripts automatically create an 'access' file for you, 
  using a default username and password of:

    superuser:123

  It is *highly recommended* that you change the default superuser 
  name and password by editing your 'access' file after running the
  build script. When you begin managing your Zope installation you
  will need to enter the superuser name and password when prompted.

  Note that you may also add an optional third component to the line
  in the access file to restrict superuser access by domain. 
  For example, the line:

    mario:nintendoRules:*.mydomain.com
 
  in your 'access' file will only allow superuser access to your 
  installation from *.mydomain.com machines. Attempts to access the
  system from other domains will fail, even if the correct superuser
  name and password are used.


Setting permissions ons on the var directory.

  Zope needs to read and write data from its var directory. Before
  running Zope you should insure that you give adequate permissions
  to the Zope var directory. For example to give full read/write
  permissions to the Zope var directory cd to the Zope directory and
  then type:

    chmod 0777 var

  Note: Zope normally runs as nobody, so full read and write permissions
  on the var directory is normally needed.
 
Using Zope with ZopeHTTPServer:

  ZopeHTTPServer is a simple web server written in Python and it
  allows you to run Zope without using PCGI and another web server.
  To start Zope using ZopeHTTPServer cd to the Zope directory and
  issue this command:

    python serve.py 

  Note: you may wish to run ZopeHTTPServer in the background and redirect
  its output to a logfile or to /dev/null

Using Zope with PCGI:

  PCGI is the traditional way of running Zope. PCGI mediates
  between your existing web server and Zope. To use PCGI copy the
  Zope.cgi file to your web server's cgi-bin directory. You can also
  create a symbolic link to Zope.cgi from your cgi-bin directory.
  For example:

    ln -s /home/amos/Zope/Zope.cgi /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/Zope

  At this point you should perform any other steps you web server
  requires to install and configure a cgi script.

  Note: For more information on PCGI checkout Jeff Bauer's PCGI pages:

  http://starship.skyport.net/crew/jbauer/persistcgi/

  If you are using Apache you will need to trick Apache into passing
  authentication headers to Zope. The easiest way to do this is to
  use mod_rewrite. Here is an example of configuration information
  which you would place in an Apache conf file:

    # Zope configuration maps /Zope/ to the Zope.cgi PCGI script
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization}  ^(.*)
    RewriteRule ^/Zope/(.*) /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/Zope.cgi/$1 [e=HTTP_CGI_AUTHORIZATION:%1,t=application/x-httpd-cgi,l]

  Note that the RewriteRule should be one long line.
  
Accessing Zope:
  
  After you either start ZopeHTTPServer or set up PCGI you should be
  able to start using Zope through the web. Point your browser to either:
  
  http://localhost:8080/manage
  
  if you are using ZopeHTTPServer or whatever the relevant URL is, if
  you are using PCGI. If you're using PCGI make sure to tack '/manage'
  on after the name of the Zope CGI script so that you go to the
  management screen. For example the URL may be something like:
 
  http://localhost/cgi-bin/Zope.cgi/manage 
 
  You will be prompted to enter a user name and a password. Enter the
  super user name and password you specified in the access file.
  
  Now your off and running! You should be looking at the Zope management
  screen which is divided into two frames. On the left you can navigate
  between Zope object and on the right you can edit them by selecting
  different management functions with the tabs at the top of the frame.
  
  If you haven't used Zope before, you should head to the Zope web site
  and read some documentation.i The Zope Manager's Guide is a good place
  to start.
