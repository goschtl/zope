  * zope.publisher
  * zope.schema

  * ZODB3

- Remaining outside imports:

  * Various of them in User.py


DocumentTemplate

- TreeDisplay should be moved into the DocumentTemplate distribution, the two
  depend on each other.

- Acceptable dependencies (we can improve on that later):

  * zope.sequencesort
  * zope.structuredtext
  * AccessControl (once it is its own distribution)
  * Acquisition
  * ExtensionClass
  * Missing
