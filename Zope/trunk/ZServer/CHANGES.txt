ZServer Changes

  This file gives information on changes made to ZServer over time,
  things that need to be done before the next release and future
  plans.

  Releases

    ZServer 1.0a2

      New Features

        Preliminary support for PCGI has been added. It is still not
        complete and bug free. The main problem is that all newlines
        seem to get converted to carriage return newline pairs...
        
        Simple controls to limit FTP connections have been added to
        help prevent denial of service attacks.
        
        FTP now supports login with a username and directory, i.e.
        'joe@Projects/JoesProject' which authenticates the login in
        the specified directory. You can still use a normal username
        and defer authentication until you cd to a directory where you
        are defined.

      Bug Fixed

        Data was being dropped from POST requests because of a bug in
        the sized input collection of asynchat.

        HTTP Response headers were not being correctly set.

        URL prefixes for the the Zope HTTP handler could not be set to
        ''. Now the empty prefix is the default, to simplify URLs.

    ZServer 1.0a1

      New Features

        Initial release. Includes new threaded architecture--currently
        limited to a thread pool of 1. Includes preliminary FTP
        support. Includes HTTP support.

      Bugs Fixed
 
        None
