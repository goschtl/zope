  plans.

  Releases

    ZServer 1.0b1
    
      New Features
      
        Major code reorganization. Major architecture changes. Future
        producers are gone. Use of special request and response objects
        to do most of the heavy lifting. 

        ZServer can now handle multiple HTTP requests per connection.

        Now using (almost) unmodified Medusa sources.
        
        Added environment variable overriding to HTTPServer.py
        
        Documented the startup script more fully.
        
        ZServer now tries to become nobody if run as root.
      
      Bugs Fixed
      
        PCGI is a lot more stable now.
      
        Using PCGI under IIS, now PATH_INFO begins with a /
        
        Fixed FTP passive mode response message IP address.
        
        Fixed multiple file upload problem where response gets out of synch.

        The log file is now not overwritten each time Zope starts.
        
        Logging works for PCGI.

      Known Bugs
      
        PCGI under IIS 4.0 is broken with respect to file uploads, and binary
        data in general. IIS seems to convert \n to \r\n in binary data :-(
        This seems to be an IIS/PCGI issue, not a ZServer issue.

      TODO
      
        More testing.
        
        Fix latest medusa select_trigger under win32.

        Re-write Zope installers to install a ZServer start script.

    ZServer 1.0a2

      New Features

        Preliminary support for PCGI has been added. It is still not
        complete and bug free. The main problem is that all newlines
        seem to get converted to carriage return newline pairs...
        
        Simple controls to limit FTP connections have been added to
        help prevent denial of service attacks.
        
        FTP now supports login with a username and directory, i.e.
        'joe@Projects/JoesProject' which authenticates the login in
        the specified directory. You can still use a normal username
        and defer authentication until you cd to a directory where you
        are defined.

      Bugs Fixed

        Data was being dropped from POST requests because of a bug in
        the sized input collection of asynchat.

        HTTP Response headers were not being correctly set.

        URL prefixes for the the Zope HTTP handler could not be set to
        ''. Now the empty prefix is the default, to simplify URLs.

        limited to a thread pool of 1. Includes preliminary FTP
        support. Includes HTTP support.
