# It is tempting to add an __int__ method to this class, but it's not
# a good idea.  This class tries to gracefully handle integer
# overflow, and to hide this detail from both the programmer and the
# user.  Note that the __str__ method can be relied on for printing out
# the value of a counter:
#
# >>> print 'Total Client: %s' % self.total_clients
#
# If you need to do arithmetic with the value, then use the 'as_long'
# method, the use of long arithmetic is a reminder that the counter
# will overflow.

	"general-purpose counter"

		except OverflowError:
			self.value = long(self.value) + delta
