Internationalization
====================

Translation
-----------

Five registers its own translation service mockup with the Page
Templates machinery and prevents any other product from also doing so.
That means, Five always assumes control over ZPT i18n.  When a certain
domain has not been registered the Zope 3 way, Five's translation
service will see that the utility lookup fails and use the next
available fallback translation service.  In case of no other
translation service installed, that is just a dummy fallback.

To register Zope 3 style translation domains, use the following ZCML
statement::

  <i18n:registerTranslations directory="locales" />

where the 'i18n' prefix is bound to the
http://namespaces.zope.org/i18n namespace identifier.  The directory
(in this case 'locales') should conform to the `standard gettext
locale directory layout`__.
