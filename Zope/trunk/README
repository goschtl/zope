Introduction:

  The source release is intended for tinkerers, those who want
  to use Zope components separately, Bobo hackers, and people
  who aren't afraid of programming.

  If you just want to use Zope easily and aren't a programmer
  the binary release will probably suit you better.

Installing Zope:

  Follow the instructions in INSTALL.txt to install Zope. You
  may wish to run the installer even if you only plan on using
  selected Zope components since the install script compiles
  Python extensions for you that you may want, like cDocumentTemplate.

Notes:

  * Zope requires Python 1.5.
  * Lots more documentation is coming.
  * Don't forget to check the Zope web site and mailing list.
  * Read the source, have fun!
