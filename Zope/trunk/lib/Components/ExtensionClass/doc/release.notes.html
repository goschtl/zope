<h1>Release Notes</h1>
<h2>1.2</h2>
<p>    This release provides some important bug fixes, some new features,
    and a new copyright.</p>

<p>    New functionality:</p>
<ul><li><p>One or more mapping objects can be passed to the MultiMapping
        constructor.</p>

</li>
<li><p>MultiMapping objects implement the has_key and get methods as
        defined for Python 1.5 dictionaries.</p>

</li></ul>

<p>    Bugs fixed:</p>
<ul><li><p>When support was added for passing acquisition wrappers to
        methods of data-less C mix-in classes, C-based __call_method__
        hooks were broken.  The most notable example of this was the
        breaking of the Synchronized class.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Calling C-base-class special methods from overriding methods,
        as in::</p>
<PRE>
          class LowerMultiMapping(MultiMapping):

            def __getitem__(self, key):
              return MultiMapping.__getitem__(self, lower(key))

        caused infinite loops.

</PRE>

</li>
<li><p>A typo in the Acquisition probably caused __delitem__
        calls on wrapped mapping objects to fail.</p>

</li></ul>


<h2>1.1</h2>
<p>     New functionality:</p>
<ul><li><p>Changed the way that methods in pure mix-in classes are
        constructed.  Now methods are wrapped in such a way that
        tricky wrapper objects (like Acquisition wrappers) can
        bind them to wrapped objects.</p>

</li>
<li><p>An "is subclass" test is provided via the macros
        <code>ExtensionClassSubclass_Check</code>, and
        <code>ExtensionClassSubclassInstance_Check</code>, which are
        documented in <code>ExtensionClass.h</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Methods and Acquisition wrappers use free list to improve
        allocation and deallocation performance.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Bound methods have attributes who's values are stored in
        their instances.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Added <code>__module__</code> attribute to ExtensionClasses to be
        consistent with Python 1.5 classes and to work correctly
        with 1.5 pickling.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Added the <code>__basic__</code> new class method to allow
        ExtensionClass instances to be unpickled without calling
        their constructors.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Acquired acquiring objects can nor acquire from the object
        they were accessed in, in addition to the object they were
        acquired from.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Added new <code>Acquisition</code> variable, <code>Acquired</code>, to support
        "Controlled Acquisition'.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Added a new <code>aq_acquire</code> method for objects that subclass
        <code>Acquisition.Implicit</code> or <code>Acquisition.Explicit</code>. This
        supports explicit acquisition and provides an option
        filter function to support "Filtered Acquisiition".</p>
<p>        The <code>acquire</code> method available in earlier releases is still
        available, but is deprecated.</p>


</li></ul>

<p>     Bugs fixed:</p>
<ul><li><p>There were some incorrect C-level error return values.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A bug in handling method chains caused "C inheritence"
        to fail.  This only affected extension types that
        inherited from extension types using method chains, <em>not</em>
        extension subclasses defined in Python inheriting from
        extension base classes defined in C.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Expressions like <code>not foo</code> or statements like::</p>
<PRE>
         if foo:
           ...

        often failed for non-collection types because of an
        incorrect attempt to take the 'len' of an object.

</PRE>

</li>
<li><p>Comparisons of objects with different classes didn't work
        correctly.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Instances provided access to their class <code>__bases__</code>
        attribute.</p>

</li></ul>


<h2>1.0.2</h2>
<p>     Bugs fixed:</p>
<ul><li><p>Fixed bug in handling subclasses of Sequence objects.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fixed comparison bug in Missing objects.</p>

</li></ul>


<h2>1.0.1</h2>
<p>    Added functionality to and fixed bug in Missing module</p>

<ul><li><p>Fixed horible reference-counting bug</p>

</li>
<li><p>Changed so that <code>Missing.Value.spam(a1,a2,whatever)</code>
      returns <code>Missing.Value</code> for any method name (except
      <code>__reduce__</code>) and any arguments.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Changed so that missing values are picklable.  Note that
      the special global, Missing.Value, is pickled in a
      slightly more efficient manner than other missing values.</p>

</li></ul>

<h2>1.0</h2>
<p>     First non-beta release</p>

<p>     This release is the result of a major rewrite and "hardening"
     effort to increase performance and reliability.  This version
     is being used in several Digital Creations products, so if
     parts are broken, we probably don't use them. :-)</p>

<p>     This release also contains several new features and example
     modules, including:</p>
<ul><li><p>Acquisition,</p>

</li>
<li><p>Custom method calls,</p>

</li>
<li><p>Class initialization protocol,</p>

</li>
<li><p>A class method that makes it possible to explicitly call
         Python base-class methods.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A sample application of custom method calls that provides
         Java-like synchronized classes that prevent more than one
         thread from accessing an object's methods at one time.</p>

</li></ul>

<p>     Note that there is one known incompatibility with previous
     releases.  In previouse releases, the method used to support
     context wrapping was named <code>__bind_to_object__</code>.  The name of
     this method was changed to <code>__of__</code> in this release and I do
     not expect this name to change in the future.
