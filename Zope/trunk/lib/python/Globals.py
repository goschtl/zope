# 3. Digital Creations requests that attribution be given to Zope

#    button that is installed by default. While it is not a license
#    violation to remove this button, it is requested that the
#    attribution remain. A significant investment has been put
#    into Zope, and this effort will continue if the Zope community
#    continues to grow. This is one way to assure that growth.

# 4. All advertising materials and documentation mentioning
#    features derived from or use of this software must display
#    the following acknowledgement:
# 
#      "This product includes software developed by Digital Creations
#      for use in the Z Object Publishing Environment
#      (http://www.zope.org/)."
# 
#    In the event that the product being advertised includes an
#    intact Zope distribution (with copyright and license included)
#    then this clause is waived.
# 
# 5. Names associated with Zope or Digital Creations must not be used to
#    endorse or promote products derived from this software without

# 
#    Intact (re-)distributions of any official Zope release do not
#    require an external acknowledgement.
# 
# 7. Modifications are encouraged but must be packaged separately as
#    patches to official Zope releases.  Distributions that do not
#    clearly separate the patches from the original work must be clearly
#    labeled as unofficial distributions.  Modifications which do not
#    carry the name Zope may be packaged in any form, as long as they
#    conform to all of the clauses above.
