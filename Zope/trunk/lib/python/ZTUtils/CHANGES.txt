    Version 1.1.0

      Features Added

        - TreeMakers have a setChildAccess() method that you can use
          to control tree construction.  Child nodes can be accessed
          through either an attribute name or callback function.
          Children fetched by attribute name can be filtered through a
          callback function.

        - A new LazyFilter class allows you to filter a sequence using
          Zope security and an optional filter callback function.  The
          security and filter tests are lazy, meaning they are
          performed as late as possible.  

          The optional 'skip' argument determines the reaction when
          access to a sequence element is refused by the Zope security
          policy.  The default (None) is to raise the 'Unauthorized'
          exception.  If a string is passed, such elements are
          skipped.  If the string is non-empty, it is treated as a
          permission name, and the element is skipped if the user
          doesn't have that permission on the element.

        - The Zope versions of TreeMaker, SimpleTreeMaker, and Batch
          now use LazyFilter. The TreeMakers have a setSkip() method
          that can be used to set the 'skip' value. Batch has an
          optional 'skip_unauthorized' argument that is passed to
          LazyFilter as 'skip'.

        - Utility functions make_query(), url_query(), and
          make_hidden_input() have been added.
