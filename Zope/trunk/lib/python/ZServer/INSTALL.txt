ZServer Installation
--------------------

Requirement

  You must have a very recent copy of Zope or at least ZPublisher
  installed.
  
  ZServer *does not* work with Zope 1.10.2. It requires some newer
  features of Zope. You can either use the lastest Zope from CVS or
  else get the latest ZPublisher package from CVS and use it with
  your current Zope installation. Zope CVS information is available
  at::
  
    http://www.zope.org/Community/CVS_public_access
  
  If this doesn't make sense to you, then wait until the next Zope
  release to use ZServer. This release is still for hackers, sorry.

Installation

  Untar and ungzip the ZServer tarball in your Zope directory. This
  will create a 'ZServer' directory in your Zope directory.

Configuration

  To run ZServer you need to edit the start script to set your
  configuration. In the future will will probably provide a customized
  start script as part of the Zope installtion process.
  
  To edit the start up script, open 'ZServer/start.py' in your
  favorite editor and change the configuration variables. If you
  understand Medusa, you can also change the rest of the script.
  
  Finally make sure the shebang line is right on the 'start.py'
  script. You can use your own copy of Python, or the copy that came
  with Zope (if you are using a binary distribution).
  
Shell scripts and batch files  
  
  You may also wish to create a shell script (or batch file under
  win32) to set environment variables (such as ZOPE_DEBUG_MODE and
  PYTHONHOME) and run the start script. 
  
  Here's an example shell script for a binary Zope release::
  
    ZOPE_DEBUG_MODE=1
    export ZOPE_DEBUG_MODE
    PYTHONHOME=/home/Zope
    export PYTHONHOME
    /home/Zope/bin/python /home/Zope/Zserver/start.py &
  
  Note: If ZServer fails because it can't find some standard Python
  libaries there's a good bet that you need to set the PYTHONHOME as
  shown above.
  
  Here's an example batch file::
  
    set ZOPE_DEBUG_MODE=1
    "\Program Files\Zope\bin\python"  "\Program Files\Zope\ZServer\start.py"
  
  Now you're ready to go.  

Starting ZServer

  To start ZServer run the start script::
  
    ./start.py
    
  To stop the server type 'control-c'.

  Note: If you've created a shell script or batch file to run ZServer
  use that instead.

  You should see some Medusa information come up on the screen.
  
  A log file will be written to the 'var' directory, named
  'ZServer.log' by default.

Using ZServer

  Once you start ZServer is will publish Zope (or any Python module)
  on HTTP and/or FTP. To access Zope via HTTP point your browser at
  the server like so::
  
    http://www.example.com:9673/
    
  This assumes that you have chosen to put HTTP on port 9673 and that
  you are publishing a module named whose URL prefix is set to ''.
  
  Note: to publish Zope normally you publish the 'lib/python/Main.py'
  module.

  To access Zope via FTP you need to FTP to it at the port you set FTP
  to run on. For example::
  
    ftp www.example.com 8021

  This opens a FTP session to your machine on port 8021, ZServer's
  default FTP port. When you are prompted to log in you should supply
  a Zope username and password. (Probably you should use an account
  with the 'Manager' role, unless you have configured Zope to allow
  FTP access to the 'Anonymous' role.) You can also enter 'anonymous'
  and any password for anonymous FTP access. Once you have logged in
  you can start issuing normal FTP commands.
  
  Right now ZServer supports most basic FTP commands.
  
  Note: When you log in your working directory is set to '/'. If you
  do not have FTP permissions in this directory, you will need to 'cd'
  to a directory where you have permissions before you can do
  anything. See above for more information about logging into FTP.

Where to go from here

  Check out the README.txt file. It contains information on what
  ZServer can do, how it works and and what you can do if you run into
  problems.
  
  And don't forget to have fun!
