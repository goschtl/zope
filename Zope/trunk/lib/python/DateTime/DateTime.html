<h1>Class DateTime</h1>

<p>DateTime objects represent instants in time and provide
       interfaces for controlling its representation without
       affecting the absolute value of the object. </p>
<p>       DateTime objects may be created from a wide variety of string 
       or numeric data, or may be computed from other DateTime objects.
       DateTimes support the ability to convert their representations
       to many major timezones, as well as the ablility to create a
       DateTime object in the context of a given timezone.</p>

<p>       DateTime objects provide partial numerical behavior:</p>
<ul><li><p>Two date-time objects can be subtracted to obtain a time,
            in days between the two.</p>


<li><p>A date-time object and a positive or negative number may
            be added to obtain a new date-time object that is the given
            number of days later than the input date-time object.</p>


<li><p>A positive or negative number and a date-time object may
            be added to obtain a new date-time object that is the given
            number of days later than the input date-time object.</p>


<li><p>A positive or negative number may be subtracted from a
            date-time object to obtain a new date-time object that is
            the given number of days earlier than the input date-time
            object.</p>

</ul>
<p>        DateTime objects may be converted to integer, long, or float
        numbers of days since January 1, 1901, using the standard int, 
        long, and float functions (Compatibility Note: int, long and
        float return the number of days since 1901 in GMT rather than
        local machine timezone). DateTime objects also provide access
        to their value in a float format usable with the python time
        module, provided that the value of the object falls in the
        range of the epoch-based time module.</p>

<p>        A DateTime object should be considered immutable; all conversion
        and numeric operations return a new DateTime object rather than
        modify the current object.</p>




<dl><dt><p><strong>Constructor For DateTime</strong></p><dd>

<dl><dt><strong>DateTime()</strong><dd>
<h3>Return a new date-time object</h3>
<p>        A DateTime object always maintains its value as an absolute 
        UTC time, and is represented in the context of some timezone
        based on the arguments used to create the object. A DateTime
        object's methods return values based on the timezone context.</p>

<p>        Note that in all cases the local machine timezone is used for
        representation if no timezone is specified.</p>

<h4>        DateTimes may be created with from zero to seven arguments.</h4>
<ul><li><p>If the function is called with no arguments, then the 
            current date/time is returned, represented in the 
            timezone of the local machine.</p>


<li><p>If the function is invoked with a single string argument
            which is a recognized timezone name, an object representing
            the current time is returned, represented in the specified
            timezone.</p>


<li><p>If the function is invoked with a single string argument
            representing a valid date/time, an object representing
            that date/time will be returned.</p>
<p>            As a general rule, any date-time representation that is 
            recognized and unambigous to a resident of North America is
            acceptable.(The reason for this qualification is that
            in North America, a date like: 2/1/1994 is interpreted
            as February 1, 1994, while in some parts of the world,
            it is interpreted as January 2, 1994.) A date/time
            string consists of two components, a date component and
            an optional time component, separated by one or more
            spaces. If the time component is omited, 12:00am is
            assumed. Any recognized timezone name specified as the
            final element of the date/time string will be used for
            computing the date/time value. (If you create a DateTime
            with the string <code>Mar 9, 1997 1:45pm US/Pacific</code>, the
            value will essentially be the same as if you had captured
            time.time() at the specified date and time on a machine in
            that timezone)
            <PRE></p>

<p>            e=DateTime(<code>US/Eastern</code>)
            # returns current date/time, represented in US/Eastern.</p>

<p>            x=DateTime(<code>1997/3/9 1:45pm</code>)
            # returns specified time, represented in local machine zone.</p>

<p>            y=DateTime(<code>Mar 9, 1997 13:45:00</code>)
            # y is equal to x</p>

<p>            </PRE></p>

<p>            The date component consists of year, month, and day
            values. The year value must be a one-, two-, or
            four-digit integer. If a one- or two-digit year is
            used, the year is assumed to be in the twentieth
            century. The month may an integer, from 1 to 12, a
            month name, or a month abreviation, where a period may
            optionally follow the abreviation. The day must be an
            integer from 1 to the number of days in the month. The
            year, month, and day values may be separated by
            periods, hyphens, forward, shashes, or spaces. Extra
            spaces are permitted around the delimiters. Year,
            month, and day values may be given in any order as long
            as it is possible to distinguish the components. If all
            three components are numbers that are less than 13,
            then a a month-day-year ordering is assumed.</p>

<p>            The time component consists of hour, minute, and second
            values separated by colons.  The hour value must be an
            integer between 0 and 23 inclusively. The minute value
            must be an integer between 0 and 59 inclusively. The
            second value may be an integer value between 0 and
            59.999 inclusively. The second value or both the minute
            and second values may be ommitted. The time may be
            followed by am or pm in upper or lower case, in which
            case a 12-hour clock is assumed.</p>



<li><p>If the DateTime function is invoked with a single
            Numeric argument, the number is assumed to be either
            a floating point value such as that returned by 
            time.time() , or a number of days after January 1, 1901 
            00:00:00 UTC.</p>
<p>            A DateTime object is returned that represents either
            the gmt value of the time.time() float represented in
            the local machine's timezone, or that number of days 
            after January 1, 1901. Note that the number of days 
            after 1901 need to be expressed from the viewpoint of
            the local machine's timezone. A negative argument will 
            yield a date-time value before 1901.</p>



<li><p>If the function is invoked with two numeric arguments,
            then the first is taken to be an integer year and the
            second argument is taken to be an offset in days from
            the beginning of the year, in the context of the local
            machine timezone.
            The date-time value returned is the given offset number of 
            days from the beginning of the given year, represented in
            the timezone of the local machine. The offset may be positive
            or negative.
            Two-digit years are assumed to be in the twentieth
            century.</p>


<li><p>If the function is invoked with two arguments, the first
            a float representing a number of seconds past the epoch
            in gmt (such as those returned by time.time()) and the 
            second a string naming a recognized timezone, a DateTime
            with a value of that gmt time will be returned, represented
            in the given timezone.
            <PRE>
            import time
            t=time.time()</p>
<p>            now_east=DateTime(t,'US/Eastern')
            # Time t represented as US/Eastern</p>

<p>            now_west=DateTime(t,'US/Pacific')
            # Time t represented as US/Pacific</p>

<p>            # now_east == now_west
            # only their representations are different</p>

<p>            </PRE></p>



<li><p>If the function is invoked with three or more numeric
            arguments, then the first is taken to be an integer
            year, the second is taken to be an integer month, and
            the third is taken to be an integer day. If the
            combination of values is not valid, then a
            DateTimeError is raised. Two-digit years are assumed
            to be in the twentieth century. The fourth, fifth, and
            sixth arguments are floating point, positive or
            negative offsets in units of hours, minutes, and days,
            and default to zero if not given. An optional string may
            be given as the final argument to indicate timezone (the
            effect of this is as if you had taken the value of time.time()
            at that time on a machine in the specified timezone).</p>

</ul>

<p>        In all cases, invalid date, time, or timezone components will
        raise a DateTimeError. </p>

<p>        The module function Timezones() will return a list of the 
        timezones recognized by the DateTime module. Recognition of 
        timezone names is case-insensitive.</p>
