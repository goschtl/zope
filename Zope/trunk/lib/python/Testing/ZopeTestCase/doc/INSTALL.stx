Installation Instructions for ZopeTestCase

    Requires Python 2.1 and Zope 2.5 or higher

    1. Extract the tarball into the 'lib/python/Testing'
       directory of your Zope installation.

    2. Cd into the ZopeTestCase directory and execute 
       'python runalltests.py' to test the package and to 
       make sure all modules get compiled.

       You must use the same Python that is running your 
       Zope here. On Windows this may for example be::

         "C:\Program Files\Zope\bin\python.exe" runalltests.py

    3. See the HOWTO for the big picture, the README for 
       getting started with your own tests.

    Visit the "ZopeTestCaseWiki":http://zope.org/Members/shh/ZopeTestCaseWiki
    for additional documentation.
