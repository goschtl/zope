# Revision 1.2  1998/04/02 17:37:34  jim
# Major redesign of block rendering. The code inside a block tag is
# compiled as a template but only the templates blocks are saved, and
# later rendered directly with render_blocks.
#
# Added with tag.
#
# Also, for the HTML syntax, we now allow spaces after # and after end
# or '/'.  So, the tags::
#
#   <!--#
#     with spam
#     -->
#
# and::
#
#   <!--#
#     end with
#     -->
#
# are valid.
#
# Revision 1.1  1998/03/04 18:19:56  jim
# added comment and raise tags
