<p>Almost all Zope objects can be owned. When you create an object you
become its owner. Ownership matters for method objects since
it determines what roles they have when they are executed. See the
<i>Proxy Roles</i> view of method objects for more information.</p>

<p><b><dtml-var title_and_id> is 
<dtml-if owner_info>
  <dtml-with owner_info mapping>
      owned 
      by &dtml-id; (&dtml-path;).
  </dtml-with>
<dtml-else>
  unowned.
</dtml-if>
</b>
</p>


<dtml-if userCanTakeOwnership>
<p>If you have the <i>Take Ownership</i> roles you can take ownership
of an object. You should do this when the owner of an object is
deleted from Zope. Normally when taking ownership you should also take
ownership of sub-objects as well.
</p>

  <form action="manage_takeOwnership">
     <p><input name="submit" type="submit" value="Take ownership of object">
     </p>
     <p><input name="recursive" type="checkbox" checked>
       Also take ownership of all sub-objects.
