<H3>Zope Credits</H3>


<P>
  The Zope software receives contributions from far and wide.  Here's
  the Zope Hall of Fame:
</P>
<UL>

    <LI>Jeff Bauer is Zope Dude Number One.  Jeff took over PCGI and
    kept pushing it forward through the years.</LI>

    <LI>Sam Rushing worked with us at Digital Creations to make Medusa
    the publishing platform for ZServer and the concurrency of Zope2.</LI>

    <LI>A subset of windows guru Mark Hammond's win32 extensions are
    bundled with win32 binary distributions of Zope.

    <LI>Martijn Pieters and Brian Hooper contributed the DTML 'in' tag reverse
    attribute.</LI>

    <LI>Phillip Eby contributed the DTML <code>let</code> tag and many
      other useful ideas, including the inspiration for the DTML
      <code>call</code>, <code>with</code> and <code>return</code>
      tags.</LI>

    <LI>The DateTime module was based on work from Ted Horst.</LI>

    <LI>Jordan Baker contributed the 'try' tag, something I've wanted
    for a long, long time.</LI>

    <LI>Martijn Pieters chipped in with a safe range function.</LI>

    <LI>Michael Hauser came up with the name "Zope".</LI>

    <LI>Eric Kidd added support for <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">
        XML-RPC</a></LI>

    <LI>Phillip Eby contributed the DTML <code>let</code> tag and many
        other useful ideas, including the inspiration for the DTML
        <code>call</code>, <code>with</code> and <code>return</code>
        tags.</LI>

    <LI>Andrew M. Kuchling wrote the initial version of mod_pcgi, making 
    him extremely cool in our book.</LI>

    <LI>Jephte CLAIN made some patches to European TimeZope.</LI>

    <LI>All the other Zopistas far and wide that stuck with us during
    the Bobo/Principia days and politely push us to make the best damn
    app server on this or any other planet.</LI>

    <LI>Of course the list of credits would be quite incomplete without
    mentioning Guido van Rossum, benevolent dictator of Python and
    long-time friend of Digital Creations.  Zope Power is Python
    Power.</LI>
