Z SQL Method - Test: Test the validity of your SQL statement
  
    Description

        This view allows you to test a SQL method.
  
    Controls

        '*[arument names]*' -- There will be one text field for each argument specified for   
        the SQL method. The text field will contain the default 
        value.
        **Important:** You must enter a value matching the specified argument type, otherwise a 
        "Type Error" is returned.
        
        'Submit Query' -- Causes the wuery to be executed and the results are returned
        as an HTML table. If the query was had a syntax error or 
        the accessed table did not exist, a database-specific error
        message is returned in form of an exception.
        
        Furthermore, if you have a SQL statement that does not 
        return any data, Zope will tell you that this SQL statement
        was not a query. Even though that may look like an error 
        message, Zope exits cleanly and does not throw an exception.
