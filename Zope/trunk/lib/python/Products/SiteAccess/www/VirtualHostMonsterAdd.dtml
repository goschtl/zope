<i>This is only useful if you are using some rewriting tool
(Apache or an Access Rule, for example) to insert these special
elements into your URL.</i><br><br>
A Virtual Host Monster changes the URLs generated by all objects
within the same Folder, using information passed to it in special URL
path elements.<br><br>
To set the protocol ('http', 'https') and host ('www.foo.com') portion
of generated URLs, insert &quot;VirtualHostBase&quot;, the protocol,
and the host into the path.<br><br>
Insert &quot;VirtualHostRoot&quot; directly after the name of the
Folder that is supposed to be the root of the virtual host.<br><br>
For example, to publish Folder &quot;/foo&quot; as <b>http://www.foo.com/</b>,
put a Virtual Host Monster in the root folder and rewrite requests for that
URL to <b>/VirtualHostBase/http/www.foo.com/foo/VirtualHostRoot/</b>
</p>
<p>Values affected include DTML variables starting with URL or BASE, and
the absolute_url() methods of objects.</p>
