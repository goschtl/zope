def manage_addZCatalog(id, title, vocab_id=None):
    """

    Add a ZCatalog object.

    'vocab_id' is the name of a Vocabulary object this catalog should
    use.  A value of None will cause the Catalog to create its own
    private vocabulary.

    """




class ZCatalog:
    """

    ZCatalog object

    A ZCatalog contains arbitrary index like references to Zope
    objects.  ZCatalog's can index either 'Field' values of object,
    'Text' values, or 'KeyWord' values:

    ZCatalogs have three types of
    indexes:

      Text -- Text indexes index textual content.  The index can be
      used to search for objects containing certain words.

      Field -- Field indexes index atomic values.  The index can be
      used to search for objects that have certain properties.

      Keyword -- Keyword indexes index sequences of values.  The index
      can be used to search for objects that match one or more of the
      search terms.

    The ZCatalog can maintain a table of extra data about cataloged
    objects.  This information can be used on search result pages to
    show information about a search result.

    The meta-data table schema is used to build the schema for
    ZCatalog Result objects.  The objects have the same attributes
    as the column of the meta-data table.

    ZCatalog does not store references to the objects themselves, but
    rather to a unique identifier that defines how to get to the
    object.  In Zope, this unique identifier is the object's relative
    path to the ZCatalog (since two Zope object's cannot have the same 
    URL, this is an excellent unique qualifier in Zope).
