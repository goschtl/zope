Session Data Manager - Add

  After instantiating at least one browser id manager, it's
  possible to instantiate a session data manager.  You'll need to
  do this in order to use session tracking.

  You can place a session data manager in any Zope container,as
  long as a browser id manager object can be acquired from that
  container.  The session data manager will use the first acquired
  browser id manager which is active (ie. it will use any acquired
  browser id manager that has not been been "turned off" via its
  Zope management interface).

  Choose "Session Data Manager" within the container you wish to
  house the session data manager from the "Add" dropdown box in
  the Zope management interface.

  The session data manager add form displays these options:

    id -- choose an id for the session data manager

    title -- choose a title for the session data manager

    transient object container path -- 
    the path in Zope to a transient object container which will
    store the actual session data.  This path is 
    /temp_folder/transient_container in a default Zope installation.

    automatic SESSION placement in REQUEST object --
    check this option to have a SESSION object automatically
    inserted into the REQUEST object, corresponding to the
    current browser's session.

  After reviewing and changing these options, click the "Add"
  button to instantiate a session data manager.

  You can manage a session data manager by visiting it in the
  management interface.  You may change all options available
  during the add process by doing this.
