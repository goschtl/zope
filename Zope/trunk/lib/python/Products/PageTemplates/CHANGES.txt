    Version 1.4.1

      Bugs Fixed

        - Tracebacks were often truncated.

        - __bobo_traverse__ objects, such as the root, triggered
          security incorrectly when traversed.

        - If a PageTemplate was owned by a missing user, or one with
          insufficient permissions, the editing form broke.
