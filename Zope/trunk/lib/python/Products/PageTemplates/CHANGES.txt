        * Bugfixes for 'repeat' variable access

2001-04-27  Evan Simpson <evan@digicool.com>

        * Version 1.2.0
        * Depends on the new ZTUtils package, which adds batching and
          tree widget capabilities.
        * Path expressions now have optional path modifiers.  These
          appear in parenthesis before the path, and include 'if',
          'exists', and 'nocall'.
        * Changed nocall: and exists: expressions types into path modifiers.
        * tal:attributes no longer inserts empty attributes into
          source.
        * The 'if' path modifier can cancel any TAL action.
