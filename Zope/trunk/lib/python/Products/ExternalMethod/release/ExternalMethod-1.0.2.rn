External Methods 1.0.2 release notes

  This is a bug-fix release.

  Bugs Fixed

    - Add permissions were not editable.

  New feature
      
    - If an ExternalMethod takes a single argument, named self, and is
      called with no arguments, then the folder in which the method
      is accessed is passed.  This is handy when the method is called 
      from a document.
