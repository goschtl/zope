External Method 1.1 release notes

  This release changes the way that ExternalMethods are bound to 
  folders.  ExternalMethods now bind themselves to their acquisition
  parents, rather than to REQUEST['PARENTS'][0].  This is needed to
  make ExternalMethods useful in trees and exprs.  The 1.1 release of
  Principia is needed for this release of ExternalMethod to
  function correctly.
