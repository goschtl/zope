"""Text Index

Notes on a new text index design

  The current inverted index algoirthm works well enough for our needs.
  Speed of the algorithm does not seem to be a problem, however, data
  management *is* a significant problem.  In particular:

    - Process size grows unacceptably *during mass indexing*.

    - Data load and store seems to take too long.  For example,
      clearing an inverted index and committing takes a significant
      amount of time.

    - The current trie data structure contributes significantly to the
      number of objects in the system.

    - Removal/update of documents is especially problematic.  We have
      to either:

      - Unindex old version of an object before updating it.  This is
        a real hassle for apps like sws.

      - Tool through entire index looking for object references.  This
        is *totally* impractical.

  Some observations of competition:

    - Xerox system can index "5-million word document in 256k".  What
      does this mean?

        - Does the system save word positions as we do?

        - What is the index indexing?

        - What was the vocabulary of the system?

      Let\'s see.  Assume a 10,000 word vocabulary.  Then we use
      25-bytes per entry.  Hm.....

    - Verity has some sense of indexing in phases and packing index.
      Verity keeps the index in multiple chunks and a search may
      operate on multiple chunks.  This means that we can add data
      without updating large records.

      This may be especially handy for mass updates, like we do in
      cv3.  In a sense we do this in cv3 and sws.  We index a large
      batch of documents to a temporary index and then merge changes
      in.

      If "temporary" index was integral to system, then maybe merger
      could be done as a background task....

  Tree issues

    Tree structures benefit small updates, because an update to an
    entry does not cause update of entire tree, however, each node in
    tree introduces overhead.

    Trie structure currently introduces an excessive number of nodes.
    Typically, a node per two or three words.  Trie has potential to 
    reduce storage because key storage is shared between words.

    Maybe an alternative to a Trie is some sort of nested BTree.  Or
    maybe a Trie with some kind of binary-search-based indexing.

    Suppose that:

      - database objects were at leaves of tree
      - vocabulary was finite
      - we don\'t remove a leaf when it becomes empty

    Then:

      - After some point, tree objects no longer change
    
    If this is case, then it doesn\'t make sense to optimize tree for
    change. 

  Additional notes

    Stemming reduces the number of words substantially.

  Proposal -- new TextIndex

    TextIndex -- word -> textSearchResult

      Implemented with:

        InvertedIndex -- word -> idSet

        ResultIndex -- id -> docData

        where:

          word -- is a token, typically a word, but could be a name or a
                  number

          textSearchResult -- id -> (score, positions)

          id -- integer, say 4-byte.
          
          positions -- sequence of integers.

          score -- numeric measure of relevence, f(numberOfWords, positions)

          numberOfWords -- number of words in source document.

          idSet -- set of ids

          docData -- numberOfWords, word->positions

       Note that ids and positions are ints.  We will build C
       extensions for efficiently storing and pickling structures
       with lots of ints.  This should significantly improve space
       overhead and storage/retrieveal times, as well as storeage
       space.
