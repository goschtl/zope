# CommitLog class
#
# This class implements the action log for writes to non-committed
# transactions.  They are replayed and applied all at once during _finish()
# which is called by BaseStorage's tpc_finish().  See FullImplementation.txt
# and notes for some discussion of the issues involved.
#
# BAW: understand this more, and figure out why we can't use BSDDB's
# lock_detect().
#
# File format:
#
# The log file consists of a standard header, followed by a number of marshal
# records.  Each marshal consists of a single character opcode and an
# argument.  The specific opcodes and arguments depend on the type of storage
# using the CommitLog instance, and derived classes provide a more specific
# interface for the storage.

# JF: POSError is the ZODB version of Exception; it's fairly generic
# so a more specific exception might be better.  E.g. StorageError

# Log file states.
#
# START is the transaction start state, and the log file must either not exist
# or be in the COMMITTED state in order to enter the START state.
START = 'S'

# OPEN state is where objects have begun to be stored into the log file during
# an open transaction.  OPEN can only be entered from the START state, and
# upon the first object store, the state goes from START->OPEN.  From here the
# transaction will either be committed or aborted.
OPEN = 'O'

# If the transaction is aborted, everything is discarded and the commit log is
# moved to the START state.  This can only happen from the START or OPEN
# state.  If the transaction is finished, then we are guaranteeing that the
# stored objects will be saved to the back-end storage.  In that case we
# change the state to PROMISED and allow the storage to read the objects out
# again.
#
# Once the transaction commit has succeeded, the file's state is moved back to
# START for the next transaction.
PROMISED = 'P'

# Magic number for log file header
MAGIC = 0xfeedb00bL
# Version number
SCHEMA = 0x01
# The format of the file header.  It consists of:
#   - a 32 bit magic number
#   - the 16-bit schema number
#   - the single character commit log state flag

        also need to be especially careful about the mode this file is written
        in, otherwise evil processes could snoop information.

        If `file' is provided it must be an already open file-like object that
