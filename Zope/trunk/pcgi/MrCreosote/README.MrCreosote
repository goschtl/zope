README.MrCreosote - JeffBauer@bigfoot.com - May 21, 1998

MrCreosote is a lightweight message-passing idiom I use
  to debug multi-processor/multi-user code sometimes.i
  It's basically just a matter of tossing out datagrams
  (connectionless sockets).  I'll document it later, in
  case anyone finds it useful for debugging.  For now,
  just ignore the contents of this directory.
