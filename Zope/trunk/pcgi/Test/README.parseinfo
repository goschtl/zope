README.parseinfo - JeffBauer@bigfoot.com - May 21, 1998

parseinfo is an executable to test the parsing the pcgi
  info file.  Although pcgifile.py can be used to test
  how the pcgi-wrapper is expected to react "in vitro"
  (i.e. as a CGI process) the parseinfo program actually
  runs the info file through the parser code  (although
  it performs no further environment testing).

usage:  parseinfo  <pcgi-info-file>
