Changes
=======

1.1.0 (unreleased)
------------------

* Use the tarfile module to extract only the data we need from the tarball.
  Probably a big optimization if the tarballs are large.
* Use Phillip Eby's suggestion to parse the PKG-INFO file in the tarball rather
  than the .egg-info files. This means we can also work with plain distutils
  distributions (however we still ignore all source packages that don't build-dep
  on setuptools).

1.0.1 (2009-06-15)
------------------

* Fix buildout versions file syntax.
* Use a very simple layout of pypi repository. All the tarballs in one directory.

1.0.0 (2009-06-15)
------------------

* Initial Release.
