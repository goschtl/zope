QueueCatalog Product Changelog

  After QueueCatalog 1.3

    - Added a dependencies document

    - Updated the tests to run on Zope 2.8+

    - Factored out queue conflict testing after changing it to use a quick 
      and dirty FileStorage, and expanding it a little.

    - Removed the security declaration for a method named refreshCatalog
      which was added in version 1.0 - this is the wrong place to apply
      product-specific settings for a product the QueueCatalog is not
      dependent on.

    - CVS-only, tag 'QueueCatalog-post-1_3-error-logging'

    - When performing deferred indexing, don't attempt (again) to
      assign brains metadata

    - When indexing an object raises an Exception, log it, and remove
      the object from the queue
