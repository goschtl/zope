FSDump ToDo's

  * Finish out the typelist for "standard" metatypes:

    - Database connectors

  * Integrate with the HelpSystem.

  * Add an ability to export permission mappings (for any
    permission which isn't acquired).

  * Add an ability to export local roles (??)

  * Introspect ZClass instances to export them using their
    propertysheets?

  * Make the dumper easier to extend (e.g., by adding
    *more* TTW code to emit FS code ;), or by registering
    handlers for new metatypes.)
