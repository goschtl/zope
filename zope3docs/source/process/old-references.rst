Old reference material
======================

This is a collection of documents I found while putting together
material for the Zope 3 process documentation. Most of those are so
outdated or never made it very far that I didn't want to include them
directly. They're here for giving an overview on what we might want to
think of.

The original Zope 3 developer wiki contains a lot of information that
still needs to be extracted. See http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/DeveloperInfo.
