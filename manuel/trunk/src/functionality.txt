Included Functionality
======================

Manuel includes several plug-ins out of the box:

:ref:`manuel.capture <capture>`
    stores regions of a document in variables for later processing

:ref:`manuel.codeblock <code-blocks>`
    executes code in ".. code-block:: python" blocks

:ref:`manuel.doctest <doctest>`
    provides traditional doctest processing as a Manuel plug-in

:ref:`manuel.footnote <footnotes>`
    executes code in reST-style footnodes each time they're referenced (good
    for getting incedental code out of the main flow of a document)

:ref:`manuel.ignore <ignore>`
    ignores parts of a document while running tests

:ref:`manuel.isolation <isolation>`
    makes it easier to have test isolation in doctests
