TransactionalMailHost
=====================

======================================================================
This software is out-dated. The functionality of TransactionalMailHost
is now part of Zope 2.11 and higher
======================================================================


What is TransactionalMailHost
=============================

TransactionalMailHost is yet another MailHost implementation.  It integrates
with the transaction system of Zope in order to send out email  only in case of
a committed transaction. TMH currently supports standard SMTP and SMTP AUTH.
TMH provides a similar functionality like MailDropHost (written by Jens
Vagelpohl) however it does not require an external process for delivering
queued emails. The intentional use of TMH are Zope sites with low-volume email
traffic.


Requirements
============

- Zope 2.9+
- zope.sendmail 


Installation
============

- Unpack the archive in your *Products* directory
- restart Zope
- create a new **TransactionalMailHost** instance through the ZMI
- configure your SMTP host, port within the ZMI.
  username and password are optional for SMTP AUTH


Notes
=====

TransactionalMailHost is not fully (yet) API compatible with the Zope MailHost
implementation. It provides only one public method right now:

   send(message, fromaddr, toaddrs, subject, encode)

   The 'subject' and 'encode' parameters are unused right now

The send() method accepts a RFC-822 compliant email message. TMH won't
do any magic to headers (like Mailhost does). It is up to the application
to provide a properly formatted message.

If you need SSL/TLS support for encrypted connections, you need to install 
a custom zope.sendmail package from svn.zope.org:

   http://svn.zope.org/zope.sendmail/branches/ajung-encryption-branch/

This package also **requires** that your Python is compiled with SSL
support. You can check this yourself using an interactive Python interpreter::

   > import socket
   > hasattr(socket, '_ssl')
   > True



How does it compare to MailDropHost
===================================

MDH decouples the process of sending mail from its delivery.  Like all other
MailHost implementations TransactionalMailHost blocks the current Zope thread
until the end of delivery. This can be a big disadvantage when you send out
email to multiple addresses. If you run a site producing lots of email you
might better checkout MailDropHost.
