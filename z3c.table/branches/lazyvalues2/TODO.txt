- implement nicer batch representation. Use div wrapper around batch links and
  give them the class rahter then set the CSS class in href tags.

- implement render methods for each batch status, e.g. renderFirstBatch,
  renderLastBatch.

- in z3c.batching, write other batch class that converts 'user side batchstart' 
  to 'table side batchstart' to play well with subset of values computed with
  LIMIT and OFFSET from RDB.
