Locale-based text collation using ICU

See the docstring in the zope.ucol package for usage information.

See INSTALL.txt for instalation instructions.

The C extension in this package was created with PyRex.  (Pyrex
rocks!) PyRex isn't required to use the C Extension, as the pre-built
C extension is included in this distribution. In addition, the C
extension was hand edited to remove some excess code included by Pyrex
that can cause compiler warnings. Hopefully, future versions of Pyrex
will make this unnecessary.
