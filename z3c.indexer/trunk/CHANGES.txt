Version 0.5.1dev (unreleased)
-----------------------------

- bugfix: SearchQuery wasn't able to act correct if initialized with query=None
  because of an empty result setup. The And() and Not() methods could not act
  correctly with this an empty initilized result.

- bugfix: SearchQuery.And() and Not() didn't return an empty result if previous
  query result was empty. And() method didn't return a empty result if given
  query was empty. The previous result was returned.

- bugfix: performance tests, not query did not show the right timer in catalog
  cell.

- feature: Expose SearchQuery.results property. Ensure that we return always an
  empty result if None is given and allow to override existing results as a
  part of the SearchQuery API.

- Optimized SearchQuery.And() and Not() methods. Skip given query processing 
  if previous result is empty.
