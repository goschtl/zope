0.2.0 (unreleased)
==================

 - Created script around create_source_tarball function with the
   z3c.recipe.eggbasket:creator recipe.  Removed the releasemaker
   console script from setup.py for now as it was not handling command
   line arguments (yet).  [maurits]

 - Added function create_source_tarball for creating the kind of
   source tarball that we are expecting.  The releasemaker console
   script calls this.  [maurits]
