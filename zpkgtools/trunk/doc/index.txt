========================
The Zope Packaging Tools
========================

Overview
--------

`Running the zpkg tool <zpkg.html>`_
  Essentially a man page for |zpkg|_.  This describes command line
  options and configuration of the tool.

`Metadata Descriptions for Distributions <metadata.html>`_
  Descriptions of the metadata files read by |zpkg|_ to allow it to
  create distributions from components.

`Resource Locations <resources.html>`_
  Information about how locations for resources are specified for
  |zpkg|_, with an emphasis on URL schemes used to support revision
  control systems.

`Collection Distributions <collections.html>`_
  A description of how collection distributions are put together.

`API documentation <apiref/index.html>`_
  Documentation on the ``zpkgtools`` interface.  The interface to this
  package is entirely open to change at this point, but this might
  help to understand how to tool works.

`To-do list <TODO.html>`_
  List of things that still need to be handled, of course.

  This PEP describes a mechanism for adding metadata to Python
  packages.  It includes specifics of the field names, and their
  semantics and usage.

  This PEP describes a mechanism for adding metadata to Python
  packages.  It includes specifics of the field names, and their
  semantics and usage.

  Implementation of PEP 262 in distutils, along with a general way to
  identify dependencies, would allow import-less dependency checking
  as well as uninstallation.
