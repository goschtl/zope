- need name + acronym to describe what gets built, not normal words
  (Jim sez)

- support for installation of packages that don't exist at the top
  level of the package hierarchy (really a distutils problem)

  - installation of "zope.app" that uses existing "zope" package

  - dealing with a package tree like the zope package tree that
    includes both pure-Python and non-pure packages; see the pkgutil
    module in Python's standard library as a possible approach to a
    solution

- fix up finddeps.py to stop searching at PUBLICATION.txt boundaries
  (have patch)

- package assembler script to build sumo/combined distro (in progress)

- CVS retriever (mostly done; need to deal with unspecified type and
  user for remote repositories)

  - can check ~/.cvspass to see if there's an entry there

  - otherwise assume :ext: if there's a CVS_RSH setting?  or just
    always?  try anonymous :pserver: access?

  - more configuration settings?

- expand the prototype section to the pre-proposal documenting the
  current effort; this lets people respond and offer suggestions

- documentation, documentation, documentation!
