===========================
Things that need to be done
===========================

- Need name + acronym to describe what gets built, not normal words
  (Jim sez).  Zope3-Dev seems to want to call them "packages".

- Package assembler script and distribution runtime

  - We should have a way to express dependence on particular versions
    of Python, and a way to say which is preferred.  (This can be used
    when building an "application" distribution since that has some
    support to select from different available Python interpreters.)

  - There should be a way to specify a Download-URL when building a
    package; using the distutils "register" command would then cause
    that field to be provided via PyPI.

    An alternative is to not include the Download-URL information in
    the distribution and to simply edit the finished registration
    manually.  This doesn't feel like it "plays nice" in the distutils
    world, though.

  - Consider looking for the configuration file in the current
    directory before looking in ~/.zpkg/.  Note that it's already
    possible to specify an configuration file, or just add additional
    resource maps, using command-line options.

  - Re-visit the abstractions for parsed revision control URLs:

    - The current abstraction is pretty painful to work with, and
      requires too much awareness of what kind of URL is being
      handled.

    - It would be really nice to be able to build a distribution from
      a Subversion branch as well as a tag for the purpose of testing
      the generated distribution, instead of having alternate resource
      maps to work from a checkout to access the branch.

  - CVS retriever (mostly done; need to deal with unspecified type and
    user for remote repositories)

    - can check *~/.cvspass* to see if there's an entry there

    - otherwise assume :ext: if there's a CVS_RSH setting?  or just
      always?  try anonymous :pserver: access?

    - more configuration settings?

    It's not clear these remaining issues are particularly important.

  - Use delayed loading of resource maps, especially those that need to
    be retrieved from remote systems.  The basic model of the resource
    map allows this strategy to be employed effectively.  Low priority.

  - Support use of http: and https: for access to Subversion
    repositories.  Very low priority since we're using svn: and svn+ssh:
    for svn.zope.org.

  - Implement tarball generation directly in Python to avoid
    dependence on external applications (because that's
    platform-specific).

  - Support different types of generated archives; bzipped tarballs,
    gzipped tarballs and ZIP archives should both be easily generated.
    Perhaps a configuration option should specify which are produced
    by default.  Low priority.

- Look at the package manager used by the MacPython people to see what
  can be/has been done.

- Deal with a package tree like the zope package tree that includes
  both pure-Python and non-pure packages; these could easily land in
  separate directory hierarchies for installations using a different
  $prefix and $exec_prefix.  (The ``pkgutil`` module from the standard
  library does not provide an acceptable solution due to a bug: see
  http://www.python.org/sf/935117 for more info.)

  (We're currently dealing with them by saying "use **--home** when
  installing" on Unix.  This may be sufficient since this isn't an
  issue for Windows systems (which never separate $prefix and
  $exec_prefix).)

- Fix up finddeps.py to stop searching at defined boundaries.  How to
  define these boundaries is in flux at the moment.

- Write a new setup.py for Zope 3 and ZODB to use in a checkout that
  uses the package metadata; this can happen after the ZopeX3 release.

  A preliminary setup.py replacement for the ZODB project is much
  shorter than the conventional setup.py (28 lines, not including the
  license blurb).

- Documentation, documentation, documentation!
