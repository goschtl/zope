- need name + acronym to describe what gets built, not normal words
  (Jim sez)

- need to add support for Subversion checkouts

- extract version number from revision control tag names

- There needs to be a better error message when two resources use the
  same name part.  The problem is that package:foo and collection:foo
  both have the same name, and zpkg tries to create two different
  directories of the same name as children of the distribution root.

  Other ways to solve the problem:

  - Remove the resource type from the resource identifier, so names
    have to be unique to begin with.  Each resource will be expected
    to identify itself in some way (possibly implicitly, such as by
    the presence of an __init__.py file).  This would mean we need an
    explicit control of how we deal with dependencies (whether or not
    we include them in the distribution package, in particular); this
    would likely be a good thing, but doesn't depend on the change in
    the resource identifiers.

  - Change the structure of the distribution, so that collection and
    package resources are located in different directories; for
    collection:foo and package:foo, we could end up with::

      foo-x.y/
          collections/
              foo/
          packages/
              foo/

- support for installation of packages that don't exist at the top
  level of the package hierarchy (really a distutils problem)

  - installation of "zope.app" that uses existing "zope" package

  - dealing with a package tree like the zope package tree that
    includes both pure-Python and non-pure packages; see the pkgutil
    module in Python's standard library as a possible approach to a
    solution

- fix up finddeps.py to stop searching at `PUBLICATION.cfg` boundaries
  (have patch)

- package assembler script to build sumo/combined distro (in progress)

- CVS retriever (mostly done; need to deal with unspecified type and
  user for remote repositories)

  - can check ~/.cvspass to see if there's an entry there

  - otherwise assume :ext: if there's a CVS_RSH setting?  or just
    always?  try anonymous :pserver: access?

  - more configuration settings?

- expand the prototype section to the pre-proposal documenting the
  current effort; this lets people respond and offer suggestions

- documentation, documentation, documentation!
