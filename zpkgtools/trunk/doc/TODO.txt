Things that need to be done
===========================

- zpkg should detect when multiple resources are used with names which
  differ only in case; this information should be used to alert users
  on Unix that Windows users will encounter problems.

- Need name + acronym to describe what gets built, not normal words
  (Jim sez).  Zope3-Dev seems to want to call them "packages".

- Package assembler script and distribution runtime

  - The **-x** and **--exclude** options and the ``<exclude>``
    configuration sections should support wildcards, similar to
    resource maps.

  - We should have a way to express dependence on particular versions
    of Python, and a way to say which is preferred.  (This can be used
    when building an "application" distribution since that has some
    support to select from different available Python interpreters.)

  - Re-visit the abstractions for parsed revision control URLs:

    - The current abstraction is pretty painful to work with, and
      requires too much awareness of what kind of URL is being
      handled.

    - It would be really nice to be able to build a distribution from
      a Subversion branch as well as a tag for the purpose of testing
      the generated distribution, instead of having alternate resource
      maps to work from a checkout to access the branch.

- Look at the package manager used by the MacPython people to see what
  can be/has been done.

- Deal with a package tree like the zope package tree that includes
  both pure-Python and non-pure packages; these could easily land in
  separate directory hierarchies for installations using a different
  $prefix and $exec_prefix.  (The ``pkgutil`` module from the standard
  library does not provide an acceptable solution due to a bug: see
  http://www.python.org/sf/935117 for more info.)

  (We're currently dealing with them by saying "use **--home** when
  installing" on Unix.  This may be sufficient since this isn't an
  issue for Windows systems (which never separate $prefix and
  $exec_prefix).)

- Fix up finddeps.py to stop searching at defined boundaries.  How to
  define these boundaries is in flux at the moment.

- Documentation, documentation, documentation!
