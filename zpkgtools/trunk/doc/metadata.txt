Metadata Descriptions for Distributions
=======================================

Overview
--------

Distributions will be described using a collection of files that
contain different aspects of the relevant metadata.  Each of these
files is optional if the information in that file is not needed.

`DEPENDENCIES.cfg`
  A list of dependencies for this distribution.  This is currently
  simply a list of imported Python packages that aren't provided with
  the distribution (listed one per line), but additional features may
  be identified by adding lines that use a prefix to denote the type
  of the dependency.  For example::

    feature:XML parser

  Blank lines and lines starting with ``#`` as the first non-white
  character are ignored.  All other lines are considered a single
  dependency; leading and trailing whitespace will be ignored.
  Dependencies are case-sensitive.

  Note that dependencies are kept separate from the information in the
  `SETUP.cfg` file since that's intended to record information about
  what the distribution contains, while dependencies serve as
  constraints on any software included in the distribution.

  For packages which only depend on the Python standard library, this
  file need not be provided.

`PACKAGE.cfg`
  Control over the files that are included in the distribution when it
  is constructed.  See `Package Construction Information`_ for
  details.

`PUBLICATION.cfg`
  General metadata related to a distribution.  This includes
  information such as the name of the component (i.e., "Frobnitz
  Manager"), author and maintainer information, and Trove
  classification.  Version information should not be included; it will
  be ignored if present (perhaps should be an error?).  This is the
  information distutils normally pushes into the generated `PKG-INFO`
  file; this file has the same format as `PKG-INFO`.  This file is
  required to create a distribution for which the component is the
  primary component.

`SETUP.cfg`
  This file contains information on building extension modules.
  Information about scripts and documentation files will also be
  included in this file.  See `Embedded Package Definitions`_ for more
  information.

Package Construction Information
--------------------------------

The `PACKAGE.cfg` file can contain three distinct sections; the
``<load>`` section identifies files that need to be loaded from
other sources, the ``<distribution>`` section is used to include
files in the distribution root, and the ``<collection>`` section is
used to include files in the component itself (even if the component
isn't a collection; this name is used since it usually will be a
collection).

The way `PACKAGE.cfg` is processed is straightforward, but warrants
explanation.  The process has the following steps:

1. A copy of the component is made that can be written to.  This is
   the *workspace*.

2. External references are loaded into the workspace.  It is
   possible for this to overwrite portions of the component itself,
   so specify the loads carefully.  This is based on the ``<load>``
   section of `PACKAGE.cfg`.

3. Files from the workspace are copied into their final locations in
   the component-specific portion of the distribution tree.

   If `PACKAGE.cfg` contains a ``<collection>`` section, it is used
   to specify which files should be copied into the
   component-specific portion of the distribution tree.  Only files
   listed will be copied.  If the ``<collection>`` section specifies
   exclusions, all files will be copied *except* for those excluded.

   If the ``<collection>`` section is not present or is empty, all
   files in the workspace are copied; directories are copied
   recursively.  Files named `.cvsignore` and directories with names
   of `{arch}`, `CVS`, `_darcs`, `RCS`, `SCCS`, or `.svn` are
   excluded.

   A copy of a file with a new name can be generated in the
   distribution tree using a line like this in `PACKAGE.cfg`:

     *source*   *destination*

   This causes the file or directory identified by *source* in the
   workspace to be copied to the name *destination* in the
   distribution tree.

   If *destination* is omitted, the destination is assumed to have
   the same name as the source.  In this case, *source* can contain
   POSIX globbing wildcards.

   Files and directories can be excluded from the collection by
   specifying exclusions instead of inclusions.  It is not possible to
   specify both using the current |zpkg|_ implementation.  An
   exclusion is similar to an inclusion, but the destination is always
   ``-`` (a single hyphen):

     *source* ``-``

   will cause files and directories matching *source* to be excluded
   from the distribution.  *source* can contain POSIX globbing
   wildcards.

4. If the component being processed is the primary resource being
   packaged, files from the workspace can be copied into the
   distribution root.  This is done using the ``<distribution>``
   section of `PACKAGE.cfg`.  This is most useful for including a
   `README.txt` in the distribution root so people unpacking the
   distribution can read about the package they've just unpacked.

   Including a file in the distribution root is done using a basic
   inclusion line of the form

     *destination*   *source*

   Unlike inclusions in the ``<collection>`` section, the
   *destination* is interpreted relative to the distribution root
   rather than the component-specific portion of the distribution
   tree.

As an example, this is the `PACKAGE.cfg` used for the ``ZConfig``
package::

  # Load the license from an external source, so we don't have to keep a
  # copy of it sitting around:
  <load>
    LICENSE.txt  http://cvs.zope.org/Zope3/ZopePublicLicense.txt?rev=HEAD
  </load>

  # Add a few things to the distribution root.
  <distribution>
    doc
    LICENSE.txt
    NEWS.txt
    README.txt
  </distribution>

  # Specify what is included in the component.
  <collection>
    # Python modules from the package:
    *.py

    # Child packages:
    components
    tests

    # Other files and directories needed when distutils runs:
    scripts
  </collection>

What isn't obvious is that one of the files in the ``ZConfig``
package under revision control isn't included in either the
distribution root or the component-specific directory (the
`BRANCHES.txt` file in particular).


Embedded Package Definitions
----------------------------

Distribution components can include a `SETUP.cfg` that contains
information about special files in the component (such as
documentation and scripts), and what extensions need to be built.
This file is a ZConfig-like configuration file that can contain the
following settings, repeated as necessary:

**documentation**
  The name of a file or directory containing documentation. This is
  used to support RPM generation.

**header**
  Identifies C and C++ header files that are provided by the package
  as part of it's API.  This is used to allow sharing of headers by C
  extensions within a distribution but in different packages; there's
  not a general way to do this with distutils.

**script**
  Only files may be identified using this.  These files are included
  in the distribution and will be installed as executable scripts for
  the end user.

For paths, POSIX path separators must be used, and Unix-style glob
expansion is performed.  Path names may not include leading or
trailing whitespace.  Directories named `CVS`, `RCS`, `SCCS`, or
`.svn` are ignored, as are files named `.cvsignore`.

Paths can only refer to descendants of the directory containing
`SETUP.cfg`, never to that directory itself or anything higher up
the filesystem hierarchy.

Support for Compiled Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compiled extensions are described using **<extension>** sections in
the `SETUP.cfg` file.  The name of the section should be the name of
the extension module within the Python package.  For example, the
extension ``persistent.cPersistence`` would be represented using a
section of the form::

  <extension cPersistence>
    ...
  </extension>

The **<extension>** section can contain the settings described below.
All of these can be repeated with the exception of the **language**
setting.

**define**
  Define additional symbols for the C preprocessor.  Values must be of
  the form ``NAME`` or ``NAME=value``.  For example::

    define NAME

  is equivalent to including the following line at the top of the C
  source::

    #define NAME

  and this::

    define NAME=value

  is equivalent to this line in C::

    #define NAME value

  The ``NAME`` portion must be a valid C identifier.

**depends-on**
  Additional files that the compiled extension depends on.  This is
  used by distutils to determine whether the extension needs to be
  recompiled.  Since the source files are identified by the **source**
  setting, this is normally only needed for header files.

  Headers provided by other packages should not be identified using
  **depends-on**, but the package that provides the needed header
  should be listed in `DEPENDENCIES.cfg`.

**language**
  The source language of the extension; this may be needed to control
  compiler selection if unusual extensions are used for the source
  files.  This is not normally needed.

**source**
  Source files for the extension.  Each file is compiled into object
  code, and the individual objects are linked to create the
  extension module.  At least one source file must be listed.

**undefine**
  Specify one or more macros that should not be initially defined by
  preprocessor.  For example, this line::

    undefine NAME ANOTHER

  is equivalent to the source lines::

    #undef NAME
    #undef ANOTHER

  at the top of the compilation unit.

Installing Additional Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Files that would traditionally be installed by identifying them in the
``data_files`` keyword argument to the ``distutils.core.setup()``
function may be identified using `SETUP.cfg` as well.

A series of **<data-files>** sections can be used for this purpose;
one section should be given for each destination directory.  Each line
of the section should give a glob pattern specifying files that should
be installed in the directory identified by the name of the section.

For example, this section::

  <data-files etc>
    myapp.conf
  </data-files>

will cause the file `myapp.conf`, found in the same directory as the
`SETUP.cfg` which includes this section, to be copied to
`$prefix/etc/myapp.conf`.

This section::

  <data-files etc/myapp>
    default-config/*
  </data-files>

will cause all the files in the `default-config` directory (a sibling
of the `SETUP.cfg` file containing this section) to be copied into the
directory `$prefix/etc/myapp/`; this directory will be created if
necessary.
