Running the **zpkg** tool
=========================

Overview and the Command Line
-----------------------------

Configuration of **zpkg** is generally required since **zpkg** always
refers to a `resource map` to provide information about the resource
its packaging.  Regardless of the availability of an appropriate
checkout, **zpkg** always uses the resource map to locate the
components it's adding to the release.

The **zpkg** command provides some command line options to control
configuration, and a very simple configuration file to allow
configurations to be saved.

The following command line options are provided:

-a, --application
  Generate an "application" distribution instead of a typical
  distutils distribution.  An application does not have a `setup.py`
  file for distutils, but has a more conventional **configure** /
  **make** / **make install** build process that creates an
  application-specific installation tree (for example,
  `/usr/local/ZopeX3`).

-c, --collection
  Collect dependencies as well as the resource named on the command
  line into a "collection" distribution; the dependencies will be
  installed in addition to the named resource.

-C FILE, --configuraion=FILE
  Load the configuration file `FILE` instead of the default
  configuration file.  `FILE` must exist.

--distribution CLASS
  Set the distribution class to be used by distutils.  By default, the
  zpkgsetup.dist.ZPkgDistribution class is used, but this allows an
  alternate class to be used instead.

-f
  Don't load any configuration file, not even the default.

-m MAP, --resource-map=MAP
  Load the resource map `MAP` before loading any map files identified in
  the configuration file.  Maps identified using **-m** take
  precedence over any identified in the configuration file.

-n NAME, --name=NAME
  Use `NAME` as the unversioned name of the resulting distribution.
  If not specified, the name portion of the resource being distributed
  is used for the package name.

-r TAG, --revision-tag=TAG
  Generate the distribution using the CVS tag `TAG` instead of the
  ``HEAD`` tag.  The revision tag is used to generate the release
  version if that's not specified directly and the tag follows the
  Zope Corporation tagging convention (see below).

-s
  Include required support packages in the distribution.  This is the
  default.

-S
  Don't include the required support packages in the distribution.
  This can be used to generate smaller distributions when the
  ``zpkgsetup`` package is known to be available on target systems.

--support RESOURCE
  Include an additional resource in the Support/ directory of the
  distribution, if the Support/ directory is included at all.  The
  additional resource should normally be a top-level Python package.
  This can be used to provide additional software to be used when
  distutils is running for the distributed package.

-v VERSION
  Set the version number of the release to `VERSION`.

--version
  Print the version number of **zpkg** and exit.

-x PACKAGE, --exclude=PACKAGE
  Name a resource (usually a Python package) to exclude the from
  distribution.  Dependencies of the named package will be included
  due to `PACKAGE` needing them, but may be included due to an another
  dependency.  This option may be given as many times as needed.

If neither **-C** nor **-f** is specified on the command line, a
default configuration file is loaded if it exists.  This is
`~/.zpkg/zpkg.conf` on Unix and `~/zpkg/zpkg.conf` on Windows (note
that there's no dot in the directory name for Windows).  The directory
containing the default configuration file can be used to store
resource maps.

If the **-f** option is used to disallow reading the configuration
file, the only way to initialize the resource map is by using the
**-m** option.


Configuration File Format
-------------------------

The configuration files used by **zpkg** use a subset of the
`ZConfig`_ configuration language.

Blank lines and comments (lines that start with ``#`` as the first
non-blank character) are ignored.

Two keys are currently defined for the configuration file:
``include-support-code`` and ``resource-map``.

The ``include-support-code`` key is used to control whether **zpkg**
bundles the support code along with the resulting distribution.  The
value is a boolean, where the strings ``true`` and ``false`` can be
used in the configuration file.  If true (the default), copies of the
``zpkgsetup`` package and any additionally configured support packages
will be included in the distribution (less the test code).  If false,
these packages will be assumed to be available for import on target
systems.

The value for ``resource-map`` is a path or URL (including
``cvs:`` URLs) for a file that defines the map.  Relative paths are
interpreted as relative to the directory containing the configuration
file.  The ``resource-map`` key may be given any number of times;
entries in the first named map take precedence over entries of the
same name in later maps.

For example, if the configuration file `/home/fdrake/zpkg.conf`
contains::

  resource-map  local.map
  resource-map  cvs://cvs.zope.org/cvs-repository:Packages2/packages.map

**zpkg** will first load the maps in the order:

1. ``/home/fdrake/local.map``
2. ``cvs://cvs.zope.org/cvs-repository:Packages2/packages.map``


.. _ZConfig: http://www.zope.org/Members/fdrake/zconfig/


Resource Maps
-------------

A `resource map` is a mapping of resource names to URLs.  The URLs
will most often be ``cvs:``, ``svn:``, or ``repository:`` URLs, but do
not have to be.  See `Resource Locations <resources.html>`_ for more
information on using URLs for specific locations.

Resources are identified by names without any whitespace; if the
resource is a Python package, the resource name is the full package
name ("ZConfig" or "zope.app.tree" for example).  Resource names must
be unique.

A file representing a resource map is a simple two-column table with
the fields separated by whitespace.  Blank lines and comments (lines
that start with ``#`` as the first non-blank character) are ignored.

The first field is the name of a resource, and the second field is the
URL by which it can be accessed.

For resources which are Python packages, a shortcut syntax can be used
to identify an entire tree of packages::

  foo    svn://svn.example.org/myproject/tags/*/src/foo
  foo.*  svn://svn.example.org/myproject/tags/*/src/foo/

allows all descendent packages of "foo" to be located.

Resource maps which have CVS locations of their own can contain
``repository:`` URLs; the ``cvs:`` or ``svn:`` URL of the directory
containing the map itself is used as the base for resolving
``repository:`` URLs.


Zope Corporation Tagging Convention
-----------------------------------

When **zpkg** is passed a **-r**/**--revision-tag** option but not a
**-v** option to explicitly set a version for the release, it will
attempt to generate a version number from the revision tag.  For this
to be successful, the revision tag must follow a convention used
within Zope Corporation.

Release tags which follow this convention all have the form:

  *name*-*encoded-version*

where *name* is the name of the package being released and
*encoded-version* is the result of a simple transformation of the
version number.  **zpkg** doesn't ever care about the name used in the
tag, only about the version information.  It is significant that the
version information follows the last hyphen in the tag name; it *must*
be the last part of the tag.  The encoded version is the version
number with all periods replaced by underscore characters; it may
prove that the replacement isn't necessary when working with
Subversion, though it is required for CVS.  The version number must
conform to a pattern of two to four numbers separated by periods,
optionally followed by one or more letters, which in turn may be
optionally followed by another number.  Reasonable examples include
``1.0``, ``0.1``, ``1.1.42``, ``2.3.4.5``, ``1.0a``, ``1.0a1``, and
``5.4.3beta2``.

For example, for the package ``mypkg``, the following tags correspond
to the following version numbers:

==================  ============
Tag                 Version
==================  ============
mypkg-1_0           1.0
mypkg-0_1           0.1
mypkg-1_1_42        1.1.42
mypkg-2_3_4_5       2.3.4.5
mypkg-1_0a          1.0a
mypkg-1_0a1         1.0a1
mypkg-5_4_3_0beta2  5.4.3.0beta2
==================  ============


Support Packages
----------------

**zpkg** creates distributions which require some additional support
packages to operate properly.  These packages are located in much the
same way that other packages are located: the resource map is
consulted to determine their location.  One difference is that if the
resource map does not define the appropriate resources, a built-in
fallback location will be used.

The fallback location for the ``zpkgsetup`` package is the copy
provided as part of the running **zpkg**; a location only needs to be
specified if a different version should be used.  (This seems highly
unlikely.)
