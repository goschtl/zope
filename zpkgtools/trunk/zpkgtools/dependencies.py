"""Support for handling dependency information.

Dependencies are stored in a file format with one dependency per line.
Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored.  Blank lines and lines
with "\#" as the first non-blank character are ignored.  Dependencies
are identified using resource identifiers; these are normalized using
the `locationmap.normalizeResourceId()` function.
