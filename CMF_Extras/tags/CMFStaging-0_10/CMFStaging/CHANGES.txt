 CMFStaging 0.9 (2004/10/27)

  - CVS-only, tag: CMFStaging-0_9

  - Staging and versioning of reference objects now works.

    To stage a reference, the tool copies both the reference and the thing
    it points to.

  - Stages now have titles in addition to names

  - Added a method to the staging tool, updateStages2(), which does the same
    thing as updateStages(), but without the from_stage argument.  This
    removes some ambiguity about which stage the object should come from.

  - Made the URLs of stages customizable.  The way this is set up may change.

  - The versions tool now gets objects unstuck before checking in.  I don't
    remember exactly how objects get in the stuck state, but this fixes it.

  - checkin() and checkout() now return None, emphasizing
    the fact that objects now retain identity after version control
    operations.

  *NOTE* that this change broke compatibility with existing staging tool
  instances.  Existing portal_staging objects will need to be deleted and
  re-created.

  Tidied up:

  - Docstring formatting

  - Use "obj" instead of "object" to avoid confusion

  - Check permissions on objects rather than on tools

  - Exceptions
