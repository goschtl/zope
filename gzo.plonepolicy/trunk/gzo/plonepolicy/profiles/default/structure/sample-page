<h2><span></span>Get started</h2>
<p>
Before you start working on your newly created Grok sandbox, please do the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Make sure you have some coffee.
        <span class="discreet">You should see a cup of coffee link in the top right corner</span></li>
    <li><a href="unvisited">Test link styles in the main body</a>.
        <span class="discreet">Grok needs the links to look cavetastic.</span></li>
    <li><a href="sample-page">Simple visited link</a>.
        <span class="discreet">Some more boring text.</span></li></ol>
<h2>Design the Grok site</h2>
<p>Here is a some more sample content for the purposes of checking the
Grok CSS. This sample content is a paragraph of text. This text has no
meaning, but it fills up the page a bit with some type and lets you see
how the typeface and spacing look.</p>
