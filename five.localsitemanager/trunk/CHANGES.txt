five.localsitemanager 0.1.1 (unreleased)
========================================

* Refactored and fixed aq wrapping: Nested site managers now return utilities
  wrapped in the right context. RequestContainers are removed and wrapped
  utilities are cached. This requires a special LookupClass called
  'FiveVerifyingAdapterLookup' in all 'utilities' registries used below a
  five.localsitemanager site.

* Fixed aq wrapping when looking up a utility that is actually the component
  registry's parent (the ISite).
