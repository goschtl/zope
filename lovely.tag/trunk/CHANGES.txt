Changes for lovely.tag
======================


2007/07/18 0.3.0b2:
===================

- in case of a not matching query lovely.tag will not longer return
  None but an empty IFTreeSet. (this is caused because zope.app.catalog
  will ignore None which results in a boolean or operation)


2007/06/13 0.3.0b1:
===================

- use iobtree for tag persistence instead of persistent list and intid
  util, should be much faster now with big numbers of tags. (this is a
  new database generation)
