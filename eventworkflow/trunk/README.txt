Prototype for a subscriber based activity workflow (WfMC style)
===============================================================

This  package contains a prototype for workflow definitions, 
that solely uses Zope's event subscriptions as the workflow "engine".
It is meant as a proof of concept.

The subpackages 'review' and 'publication' each contain a complete 
concrete workflow.
