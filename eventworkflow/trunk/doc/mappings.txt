Mappings of WfMC terms -> Zope3 Event Model
=======================================

ProcessDefinition and Activity(=ActivityDefinition) map to 
class definitions. That way its easy to instantiate them, 
meaning that ProcessInstance and ActivityInstance map to 
objects. Each Activity defines its own interface (mostly 
just a marker to subscribe to).

A SubProcess is a ProcessInstance that behaves like an 
ActivityInstance in the parent process (see e.g. the reuse of the 
review workflow within the publication workflow) Storing of the 
results of the sub process can be done by a subscriber to 
ProcessFinishedEvent of the sub process.

Transitions are subscribers to workflow related events (process 
started, activity finished, process finished, ...). 

Splits & Joins
--------------

Since you can control the starting of activities using the full
expressive power of Python, implementing AND, OR, XOR-Splits is
straight forward. Just start as many activity instances as 
needed.

Joins are a bit more complicated:

OR-Joins (1 of many parallel activities finished suffices to 
start next) can be modelled using a single subscriber which is 
subscribed to ActivityFinished events of multiple activities. 
State has to be tracked somewhere though, if the following 
activity should be fired once only.

AND-Joins depend on the nature of the join condition

a) If you just want to keep track that the all previous activities are 
finished you can put an annotation to the follow up activity which
is generated in an inactive state. On meeting the precondition 
this instance is activated (i.e. generates the work items). The 
annotation stores the state of the join. A single multiple interface 
subscriber cares about tracking state and condition.

b) The condition is about workflow data, so there is no need for the 
annotation. State is stored implicitly in the workflow data. 
A single subscriber is sufficient checking the precondition every 
time one of the previous activities finishes. There is no need for 
having a stateful follow up activity, since it is created after the
precondition is met.
