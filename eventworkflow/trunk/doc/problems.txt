Areas in subscriber based workflow I (TF) feel uneasy about
== i.e. need more brain storming

Subprocesses
------------

A nested subprocess is mapped to a process that also implements
IActivity. This naturally fits to the adapter model.

I wasn't able yet to come up with an adapter solution though.

Passing data from subprocess to parent process
----------------------------------------------

At the moment the data is just copied over the parents 
process data. No unique ids. No removal of attributes. E.g.
there is the reviewComment data hanging around in the workflow data 
but it is obsolete when the object under review is accepted.

AND Join
--------

The AND join is implemented using annotations. That requires 
stateful activities (inactive -> active). Maybe we could get 
around this storing the JOIN state somewhere else. Workflow data?
Annotations to process instance?

Workflow data handling
----------------------

This is a simple dict of the process instance as of now. Depending
on the complexity of the data that might not be sufficient.
