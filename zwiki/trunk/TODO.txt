General
-------

  - Save older versions of pages

  - Check why `handle_save_action` and `handle_preview_action`
    in `zwiki.browser.wikipage.EditWikiPage` is called two times.

  - full i18n support, now some strings are not i18ned

  - fix [[Test Link]] problem in code area
    eg:-
       This will not work::

           [[Test Link]]

Rendering/Views
---------------

  - Create custom HTMLDocument class for rendering the STX and ReST in Wiki
    style.

  - Make sure WebDAV works.

  - Add File Extension recognition.

  - Create a Management screen (advancedform) that is accessible for users
    without management rights.


Other Features
--------------

  - Make use of Traverser features; i.e. create links that include
    parents...

  - Check in Traverser that found subobj has self.context as parent.

  - Activating diff support for edited Wiki Pages. The main issue right now
    is to get to the old version of the text. so that we can execute the
    Differ.

  - Update POT and translations

  - Allow for multiple parents. The WikiPageHierarchyAdapter.path() method
    only returns the path of a wiki and not all the possible paths it has.

  - Make use of indices in search, once they are back in the core again.
