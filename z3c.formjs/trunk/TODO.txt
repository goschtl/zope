 - ajax form submission - ala "save" button

 - client side js validators for simple fields.  (maybe we can use an
   existing library?)

- Make decorators less intrusive. They should return the original object, not
  something they created, so that we can better pipe them, like::

    @jsevent.handler(IFields['one'])
    @jsevent.handler(IFields['two'])
    def handleOneAndTwo(self, ...):
        pass
