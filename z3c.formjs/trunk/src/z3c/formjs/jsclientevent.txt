Mapping Events Between Server and Client
========================================

The ``jsclientevent`` module of this package provides an extremely
minimal event framework whereby events that occur on the server, such
as ``IObjectModifiedEvent``s, propagate to a clients browser through
injected JavaScript function calls.  This is not to be confused with
"action events" that occur on the client such as onClick.

  >>> from z3c.formjs import jsclientevent

There are several components these types of interactions.  First there
are the server events, which, for example, are thrown on a state
change.  Next there is a client listener, which is just a javascript
function that gets called when the event occurs, and finally there is
the "event transport" which allows the server to call a function
defined on the client side.


Client Side Listener
--------------------

The client side event listener is just a JavaScript function that gets
called when the event occurs.  In order for the server to know which
JavaScript functions to call, we must define the JavaScript function
itself on the server, in python, so it can be referenced by the
server.  This works a lot like the jsfunction module with slight
modifications.

Let's create a simple view class with an event listener for the
IObjectModifiedEvent

  >>> from zope.lifecycleevent.interfaces import IObjectModifiedEvent
  >>> class View(object):
  ...
  ...     @jsclientevent.listener(IObjectModifiedEvent)
  ...     def modifiedListener(self, data):
  ...         return 'alert("object modified: " + data);'

The argument passed to the ``listener`` decorator is the interface for
the event that this function will be listening for.  This is the only
thing that makes this decorator different from the jsfunction.function
decorator.  Specifically, the jsclientevent.listener decorator sets
the namespace of the function based on the type of event passed to it.

All these event listeners are collected in the ``jsFunctions``
attribute because that is after all what they are.

  >>> View.jsFunctions
  <JSFunctions
     {'zope_lifecycleevent_interfaces_IObjectModifiedEvent': [<JSFunction modifiedListener>]}>

  >>> print View.jsFunctions.render()
  var zope_lifecycleevent_interfaces_IObjectModifiedEvent = {
    modifiedListener: function(data) {
      alert("object modified: " + data);
    }
  }


Server Side Listeners
---------------------

So, we need a subscriber on the server side that listens for
server side events that are relevant and sticks the event into the
request to be rendered by the form at the end of the interaction.
First we need to register the subscriber.

  >>> import zope.component
  >>> zope.component.provideHandler(jsclientevent.serverToClientEventLoader,
  ...                               (IObjectModifiedEvent,))

  >>> from zope.event import notify
  >>> from zope.lifecycleevent import ObjectModifiedEvent
  >>> notify(ObjectModifiedEvent('foo'))

Let's create a typical use case scenario:

First the setup:

  >>> from z3c.form.testing import setupFormDefaults
  >>> setupFormDefaults()
  >>> from z3c.formjs import testing
  >>> testing.setupRenderers()


Create a content component for an "article"

  >>> import zope.interface
  >>> import zope.schema
  >>> class IArticle(zope.interface.Interface):
  ...     title = zope.schema.TextLine(title=u'Title')

  >>> class Article(object):
  ...     zope.interface.implements(IArticle)
  ...     title = u'Default Title'

  >>> article = Article()
  >>> article.title
  u'Default Title'

Create an Edit Form for said content component.

  >>> from z3c.form import form, field
  >>> class ArticleEditForm(jsclientevent.ClientEventsForm,
  ...                       form.EditForm):
  ...     fields = field.Fields(IArticle)
  ...
  ...     @jsclientevent.listener(IObjectModifiedEvent)
  ...     def alertModifiedEvent(self, data):
  ...         return ('alert("You modified the object.\ndata: "'
  ...                 ' + data + "\nPlease reload the page."')

Now we will instantiate the form and modify the object.

  >>> from z3c.form.testing import TestRequest
  >>> request = TestRequest(form={'form.widgets.title':u'New Title',
  ...                             'form.buttons.apply':u'Apply'})
  >>> from zope.security import management
  >>> from zope.security.testing import Participation
  >>> management.endInteraction()
  >>> management.newInteraction(request)

  >>> form = ArticleEditForm(article, request)
  >>> form.update()

The request tells the form to update the title of the article, and
subsequently send out an object modified event.  This event gets
picked up by our handler, and stored in the request's annotations

  >>> request.annotations[jsclientevent.CLIENT_EVENT_REQUEST_KEY]
  [<zope.app.event.objectevent.ObjectModifiedEvent object at ...>]

More importantly, now our form knows about this event.

  >>> form.eventCalls
  [<zope.app.event.objectevent.ObjectModifiedEvent object at ...>]
