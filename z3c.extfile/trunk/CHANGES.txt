=======================
Changes for z3c.extfile
=======================

0.1.1 (2007-11-22)
==================

- added testing.py for simpler use of extfile in tests

- Use product config z3c.extfile:storagedir to set the storage directory

- Registration of utility is now logged on INFO

- New ++static++ namespace and index.html view for IReadFile, see
  namespace.txt. This adds a dependency to z3c.filetype.

- delete datamanager on transaction boundaries. this is needed if
  running multiple tests with different hashdirs
