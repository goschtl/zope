Python-oriented oage and form library
=====================================

This project provides a set of modules for defining pages and forms
with Python code (as opposed to ZCML).  The project provides the
zope.formlib package.  The formlib package depends on zope.app and
this needs pretty much a full application server to be tested and
used.   To use the package, check out, copy, or link (via svn
externals) the formlib package into a zope package.
